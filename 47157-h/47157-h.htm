<h2>PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.</h2>


<p>The studies of Greek Poets, now reprinted, appeared in England
in two series, published at an interval of three or four
years. In preparing this edition, I have rearranged the chapters
of both series in their proper order, and have made certain
additions, with the view of rendering the book more complete
as a survey of Greek Poetry. Thus I have inserted several new
translations in the chapters on the Lyric Poets and the Anthology.
The criticism of Euripides has been enlarged, and
the concluding chapter has been, in a great measure, rewritten.
Each chapter has undergone such revision and alteration
in minor details as might remove unnecessary repetitions and
bring the whole series of essays into harmony. At the same
time I have judged it inexpedient to introduce radical changes
into a book which professes to be the reprint of volumes already
known to the English public. For this reason the chapters
which deal with the Greek Tragedians have been left substantially
in their original form, and bear upon their face the
record of their composition as almost independent essays.</p>

<p>The most fascinating problems of history are veiled as closely
from our curiosity as the statue of Egyptian Isis. Nothing is
known for certain about the emergence from primitive barbarism
of the great races, or about the determination of national characteristics.
Analogies may be adduced from the material world;
but the mysteries of organized vitality remain impenetrable.
What made the Jew a Jew, the Greek a Greek, is as unexplained
as what daily causes the germs of an oak and of an ash to produce
different trees. All we know is that in the vague and infinitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
distant past races were nourished into form and individuality
by the varied operation of those unreckoned sympathies
which attach man to nature, his primitive mother. But the laws
of that rudimentary growth are still unknown; "the abysmal
deeps of personality" in nations as in men remain unsounded:
we cannot even experimentalize upon the process of ethnical development.</p>

<p>Those mighty works of art which we call languages, in the construction
of which whole peoples unconsciously co-operated, the
forms of which were determined not by individual genius, but by
the instincts of successive generations, acting to one end, inherent
in the nature of the race&mdash;those poems of pure thought and fancy,
cadenced not in words, but in living imagery, fountain-heads of
inspiration, mirrors of the mind of nascent nations, which we call
Mythologies&mdash;these surely are more marvellous in their infantine
spontaneity than any more mature production of the races which
evolved them. Yet we are utterly ignorant of their embryology:
the true science of Origins is as yet scarcely in its cradle.</p>

<p>Experimental philologers may analyze what remains of early
languages, may trace their connections and their points of divergence,
may classify and group them. But the nature of the organs
of humanity which secreted them is unknown, the problem
of their vital structure is insoluble. Antiquarian theorists may
persuade us that myths are decayed, disintegrated, dilapidated
phrases, the meaning of which had been lost to the first mythop&#339;ists.
But they cannot tell us how these splendid flowers,
springing upon the rich soil of rotting language, expressed in
form and color to the mental eye the thoughts and aspirations
of whole races, and presented a measure of the faculties to be developed
during long ages of expanding civilization. If the boy is
father of the man, myths are the parents of philosophies, religions,
polities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>To those unknown artists of the prehistoric age, to the language-builders
and myth-makers, architects of cathedrals not
raised with hands, but with the spirit of man, for humanity to
dwell therein, poets of the characters of nations, sculptors of the
substance of the very soul, melodists who improvised the themes
upon which subsequent centuries have written variations, we ought
to erect our noblest statues and our grandest temples. The work
of these first artificers is more astonishing in its unconsciousness,
more effective in its spontaneity, than are the deliberate and calculated
arts of sculptor, painter, poet, philosopher, and lawgiver of
the historic periods.</p>

<p>Some such reflections as these are the natural prelude to the
study of a literature like that of the Greeks. Language and mythology
form the vestibules and outer courts to Homer, Pheidias,
Lycurgus.</p>

<p>It is common to divide the history of Greek literature into
three chief periods: the first embracing the early growth of poetry
and prose before the age in which Athens became supreme
in Hellas&mdash;that is, anterior to about 480 B.C.; the second coinciding
with the brilliant maturity of Greek genius during the
supremacy of Athens&mdash;that is, from the termination of the Persian
war to the age of Alexander; the third extending over the
decline and fall of the Greek spirit after Alexander's death&mdash;that
is, from B.C. 323, and onwards, to the final extinction of Hellenic
civilization. There is much to be said in favor of this division.
Indeed, Greek history falls naturally into these three sections.
But a greater degree of accuracy may be attained by breaking up
the first and last of these divisions, so as to make five periods instead
of three. After having indicated these five periods in outline,
we will return to the separate consideration of them in detail
and in connection with the current of Greek history.</p>

<p>The first may be termed the Heroic, or Prehistoric, or Legendary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
period. It ends with the first Olympiad, B.C. 776, and its
chief monuments are the epics of Homer and Hesiod. The second
is a period of transition from the heroic or epical to that of
artistic maturity in all the branches of literature. In this stage
history, properly so called, begins. The Greeks try their strength
in several branches of composition. Lyrical, satirical, moral, and
philosophical poetry supplant the epic. Prose is cultivated. The
first foundations of the drama are laid. The earliest attempts at
science emerge from the criticism of old mythologies. The whole
mind of the race is in a ferment, and, for the moment, effort and
endeavor are more apparent than mastery and achievement. This
period extends from B.C. 776 to B.C. 477, the date of the Athenian
league. The third period is that of the Athenian supremacy.
Whatever is great in Hellas is now concentrated upon Athens.
Athens, after her brilliant activity during the Persian war, wins
the confidence and assumes the leadership of Greece. Athens is
the richest, grandest, most liberal, most cultivated, most enlightened
state of Hellas. To Athens flock all the poets and historians
and philosophers. The drama attains maturity in her theatre.
Philosophy takes its true direction from Anaxagoras and
Socrates. The ideal of history is realized by Thucydides. Oratory
flourishes under the great statesmen and the demagogues of
the republic. During the brief but splendid ascendency of Athens,
all the masterpieces of Greek literature are simultaneously
produced with marvellous rapidity. Fixing 413 B.C. as the date
of the commencement of Athenian decline, our fourth period,
which terminates in B.C. 323 with the death of Alexander, is
again one of transition. The second period was transitional
from adolescence to maturity. The fourth is transitional from
maturity to old age. The creative genius of the Greeks is now
less active. We have, indeed, the great names of Plato, Aristotle,
and Demosthenes to give splendor to this stage of national existence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
but the sceptre has passed away from the Greek nation
proper. Their protagonist, Athens, is in slavery. The civilization
which they had slowly matured, and which at Athens had
been reflected in the masterpieces of art and literature, is now
spread abroad and scattered over the earth. Asia and Egypt are
Hellenized. The Greek spirit is less productive than it has been;
but it is not less vigorous. It still asserts itself as the greatest
in the world; but it does so relying more upon its past acquirements
than on any seeds of power that remain to be developed in
the future. The fifth period, the longest of all, is one of decline
and decay. It extends from B.C. 323 to the final extinction of
classical civilization. Two chief centres occupy our attention&mdash;Athens,
where the traditions of art and philosophy yet linger,
where the Stoics and Epicureans and the sages of the New Academy
still educate the world and prepare a <i>nidus</i> for the ethics of
Christianity; and Alexandria, where physical science is cultivated
under the Ptolemies, where mystical theology flourishes in the
schools of the Neoplatonists, where libraries are formed and the
labor of literary criticism is conducted on a gigantic scale, but
where nothing new is produced except the single, most beautiful
flower of idyllic poetry and some few epigrams. In this fifth
period, Rome and Byzantium, where the Greek spirit, still vital,
overlives its natural decay upon a foreign soil, close the scene.</p>

<p>In these five periods&mdash;periods of superb adolescence, early manhood,
magnificent maturity, robust old age, and senility&mdash;we can
trace the genius of the Greeks putting forth its vigor in successive
works of art and literature, concentrating its energy at first
upon its own self-culture, then extending its influence in every direction,
and controlling the education of humanity, finally contenting
itself with pondering and poring on its past, with mystical
metaphysics and pedantic criticism. Yet even in its extreme
decadence the Hellenic spirit is still potent. It still assimilates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
transmutes, and alchemizes what it works upon. Coming into
contact with the new and mightier genius of Christianity, it forces
even that first-born of the Deity to take form from itself. One
dying effort of the Greek intellect, if we may so speak, is to formulate
the dogma of the Trinity and to impress the doctrine of the
Logos upon the author of the Gospel of St. John. The analogy
between the history of a race so undisturbed in its development
as the Greek, and the life of a man, is not altogether fanciful. A
man like Goethe, beautiful in soul and body, exceedingly strong
and swift and active and inquisitive in all the movements of his
spirit, first lives the life of the senses and of physical enjoyment.
His soul, "immersed in rich foreshadowings of the world," has
scarcely begun to think consciously in the first period. But he
feels the glory of existence, the strivings of inexhaustible energy,
the desire of infinite expansion. The second period is one of
<i>Sturm und Drang</i>. New things are learned: much of the beautiful
physical activity is sacrificed; he discovers that life involves
care and responsibility as well as pleasure; he concentrates his
mental faculty on hard and baffling study, in which at first he
halts and falters. Then he goes forth to the world and wins
great fame, and does the deeds and thinks the thoughts by which
he shall be known to all posterity. His physical and mental faculties
are now in perfect harmony; together they offer him the
noblest and most enduring pleasures. But after a while his productiveness
begins to dwindle. He has put forth his force, has
fully expressed himself, has matured his principles, has formed his
theory of the world. Our fourth period corresponds to the early
old age of such a man's life. He now applies his principles, propagates
his philosophy, subordinates his fancy, produces less, enjoys
with more sobriety and less exhilaration, bears burdens, suffers disappointments,
yet still, as Solon says, "learns always as he grows
in years." Then comes the fifth stage. He who was so vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and splendid now has but little joy in physical life; his brain is
dry and withering; he dwells on his old thoughts, and has no faculty
for generating new ones; yet his soul contains deep mines of
wisdom; he gives counsel and frames laws for younger generations.
And so he gradually sinks into the grave. His acts remain:
his life is written.</p>

<p>The great name of Homer covers the whole of the first period
of Greek literature.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is from the Homeric poems alone that
we can form a picture to our imagination of the state of society
in prehistoric Hellas. The picture which they present is so lively
in its details, and so consistent in all its parts, that we have no
reason to suspect that it was drawn from fancy. Its ideal, as distinguished
from merely realistic, character is obvious. The poet
professes to sing to us of heroes who were of the seed of gods,
whose strength exceeded tenfold the strength of actual men, and
who filled the world with valiant deeds surpassing all that their
posterity achieved. Yet, in spite of this, the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>
may be taken as faithful mirrors of a certain phase of Greek society,
just as the <i>Niebelungen Lied</i>, the romances of Charlemagne,
and the tales of the Round Table reflect three stages in the history
of feudalism. We find that in this earliest period of Greek history
the nation was governed by monarchs each of whom claimed
descent from a god. Thus the kings exercised their power over
the people by divine right; but at the same time a necessary condition
of their maintaining this supremacy was that they should
be superior in riches, lands, personal bravery, and wisdom. Their
subjects obeyed them, not merely because they were &#916;&#953;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, or
because they were fathers of the people, but also, and chiefly, because
they were the ablest men, the men fitted by nature to rule,
the men who could be depended upon in an emergency. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>king had just so much personal authority as he had ability to acquire
or to assert. As soon as this ability failed, the sceptre departed
from him. Thus Laertes overlives his royalty; and the
suitors of Penelope, fancying that Ulysses is dead, take no heed
of Telemachus, who ought to rule in his stead, because Telemachus
is a mere lad; but as soon as the hero returns, and proves
his might by stringing the bow, the suitors are slain like sheep.
Again, Achilles, while acknowledging the sway of Agamemnon,
quarrels with him openly, proving his equality and right to such
independence as he can assert for himself. The bond between
the king in the heroic age and his chieftains was founded on the
personal superiority of the suzerain, and upon the necessity felt
for the predominance of one individual in warfare and council.
The chiefs were grouped around the monarch like the twelve
peers round Charlemagne, or like the barons whose turbulence
Shakespeare has described in <i>Richard II.</i> The relation of the
Homeric sovereign to his princes was, in fact, a feudal one.
Olympus repeats the same form of government. There Zeus is
monarch simply because he wields the thunder. When Her&egrave;
wishes to rebel, Heph&aelig;stus advises her to submit, because Zeus
can root up the world, or hurl them all from the crystal parapet
of heaven. Such, then, is the society of kings and princes in Homer.
They stand forth in brilliant relief against the background,
gray and misty, of the common people. The masses of the nation,
like the chorus in tragedy, kneel passive, deedless, appealing
to Heaven, trembling at the strokes of fate, watching with anxiety
the action of the heroes. Meanwhile the heroes enact their drama
for themselves. They assume responsibility. They do and suffer
as their passions sway them. Of these the greatest, the most truly
typical, is Achilles. In Achilles, Homer summed up and fixed
forever the ideal of the Greek character. He presented an imperishable
picture of their national youthfulness, and of their ardent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
genius, to the Greeks. The "beautiful human heroism" of
Achilles, his strong personality, his fierce passions controlled and
tempered by divine wisdom, his intense friendship and love that
passed the love of women, above all, the splendor of his youthful
life in death made perfect, hovered like a dream above the imagination
of the Greeks, and insensibly determined their subsequent
development. At a later age, this ideal was destined to be realized
in Alexander. The reality fell below the ideal: for <i>rien n'est
si beau que la fable, si triste que la v&eacute;rit&eacute;</i>. But the life of Alexander
is the most convincing proof of the importance of Achilles
in the history of the Greek race.</p>

<p>If Achilles be the type of the Hellenic genius&mdash;radiant, adolescent,
passionate&mdash;as it still dazzles us in its artistic beauty and unrivalled
physical energy, Ulysses is no less a true portrait of the
Greek as known to us in history&mdash;stern in action, ruthless in his
hatred, pitiless in his hostility, subtle, vengeful, cunning; yet at the
same time the most adventurous of men, the most persuasive in eloquence,
the wisest in counsel, the bravest and coolest in danger.
The <i>Gr&aelig;culus esuriens</i> of Juvenal may be said to be the caricature
in real life of the idealized Ulysses. And what remains to the present
day of the Hellenic genius in the so-called <i>Greek nation</i> descends
from Ulysses rather than Achilles. If the Homeric Achilles
has the superiority of sculpturesque and dramatic splendor, the
Homeric Ulysses excels him on the ground of permanence of type.</p>

<p>Homer, then, was the poet of the heroic age, the poet of Achilles
and Ulysses. Of Homer we know nothing, we have heard too
much. Need we ask ourselves again the question whether he existed,
or whether he sprang into the full possession of consummate
art without a predecessor? That he had no predecessors,
no scattered poems and ballads to build upon, no well-digested
body of myths to synthesize, is an absurd hypothesis which the
whole history of literature refutes. That, on the other hand, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
never was a Homer&mdash;that is to say, that some diaskeuast, acting
under the orders of Pisistratus, gave its immortal outline to the
colossus of the <i>Iliad</i>, and wove the magic web of the <i>Odyssey</i>&mdash;but
that no supreme and conscious artist working towards a well-planned
conclusion conceived and shaped these epics to the form
they bear, appears to the spirit of sound criticism equally untenable.
The very statement of this alternative involves a contradiction
in terms; for such a diaskeuast must himself have been a
supreme and conscious artist. Some Homer did exist. Some
great single poet intervened between the lost chaos of legendary
material and the cosmos of artistic beauty which we now possess.
His work may have been tampered with in a thousand ways, and
religiously but inadequately restored. Of his age and date and
country we may know nothing. But this we do <i>know</i>, that the
fire of moulding, fusing, and controlling genius in some one brain
has made the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> what they are.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The epic poet merges his personality in his poems, the words
of which he ascribes to the inspiration of the muse. The individual
is nowhere, is forgotten in the subject and suppressed, while
the luminous forms of gods and heroes move serenely across the
stage, summoned and marshalled by the maidens of Helicon. In
no other period of Greek literature shall we find the same unconsciousness
of self, the same immersion in the work of art. In
this respect the poetry of the heroic age answers to the condition
of prehistoric Hellas, where as yet the elements of the Greek race
remain still implicit in the general mass and undeveloped. We
hear in Homer of no abrupt division between Dorians and Ionians.
Athens and Sparta have not grown up into prominence as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>the two leaders of the nation. Argos is the centre of power;
but Phthiotis, the cradle of the Hellenes, is the home of Achilles.
Ulysses is an islander. In the same way in Homer the art of the
Greeks is still a mere potentiality. The artistic sentiment, indeed,
exists in exquisite perfection; but it is germinal, not organized
and expanded as it will be. We hear of embroidery for royal
garments, of goldsmith's work for shields and breastplates, of
stained ivory trappings for chariots and horses. But even here
the poet's imagination had probably outrun the fact. What he
saw with his fancy, could the heroic artisans have fashioned with
their tools? Is not the shield of Achilles, like Dante's pavement
of the purgatorial staircase, a forecast of the future? Architecture
and sculpture, at any rate, can scarcely be said to exist. Ulysses
builds his own house. The statues of the gods are fetiches.
But, meanwhile, the foundation of the highest Greek art is being
laid in the cultivation of the human body. The sentiment of
beauty shows itself in dances and games, in the races of naked
runners, in rhythmic processions, and the celebration of religious
rites. This was the proper preparation for the after-growth of
sculpture. The whole race lived out its sculpture and its painting,
rehearsed, as it were, the great works of Pheidias and Polygnotus
in physical exercise before it learned to express itself in
marble or in color. The public games, which were instituted in
this first period, further contributed to the cultivation of the sense
of beauty which was inherent in the Greeks.</p>

<p>The second period is one of transition&mdash;in politics, in literature,
in the fine arts. Everywhere the old landmarks are being broken
up, and the new ones are not yet fixed. The heroic monarchies
yield first of all to oligarchies, and then to tyrannies; the tyrannies
in their turn give place to democracies, or to constitutional
aristocracies. Argos, the centre of heroic Hellas, is the first to
change. Between 770 and 730 B.C. Pheidon usurps the sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
power, and dies, leaving no dynasty behind him.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Between
650 and 500 we find despots springing up in all the chief Greek
cities. At Corinth the oligarchical family of the Bacchiad&aelig; are
superseded by the tyrants Cypselus and Periander. At Megara
the despot Theagenes is deposed and exiled. At Sicyon the Orthagorid&aelig;
terminate in the despot Cleisthenes, whose reign is
marked by an attempt to supersede the ancient Doric order of
government by caste. At Mitylene, Pittacus becomes a constitutional
autocrat, or dictator, for the public safety. At Samos, Polycrates
holds a post of almost Oriental despotism. At Athens
we find the great family of the Pisistratid&aelig;, who supersede the
dynastic tyranny in commission of the house of Codrus. What
is the meaning of these changes? How does the despot differ
from the heroic monarch, who held, as we have seen, his power by
divine right, but who also had to depend for his ascendency on
personal prowess? Gradually the old respect for the seed of Zeus
died out. Either the royal families abused their power or became
extinct, or, as in the case of Athens and Sparta, retained hereditary
privileges under limitations. During this decay of the Zeus-born
dynasties the cities of Greece were a prey to the quarrels of
great families; and it often happened that one of these obtained
supreme power&mdash;in which case a monarchy, based not on divine
right, but on force and fear, was founded; or else a few of the
chief houses combined against the State to establish an oligarchy.
The oligarchies, owing their authority to no true, legal, or religious
fount of honor, were essentially selfish, and were exposed to
the encroachments of the more able among their own families.
The cleverest man in an oligarchy tended to draw the power into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>his own hands; but in this he generally succeeded by first flattering
and then intimidating the people. Thus in one way or another
the old type of dynastic government was superseded by despotisms,
more or less arbitrary, tending to the tyranny of single
individuals, or to the coalition of noble houses, and bringing with
them the vices of greed, craft, and servile cruelty. The political
ferment caused a vast political excitement. Party strove against
party; and when one set gained the upper hand, the other had to
fly. The cities of Hellas were filled with exiles. Diplomacy and
criticism occupied the minds of men. Personal cleverness became
the one essential point in politics. But two permanent advantages
were secured by this anarchy to the Greeks. The one was
a strong sense of the equality of citizens; the other, a desire for
established law, as opposed to the caprice of individuals and to
the clash of factions in the State. This, then, is the first point
which marks the transitional period. The old monarchies break
up, and give place to oligarchies first, and then to despotism.
The tyrants maintain themselves by violence and by flattering
the mob. At last they fall, or are displaced, and then the states
agree to maintain their freedom by the means of constitutions
and fixed laws. The despots are schoolmasters, who bring the
people to <i>Nomos</i> as their lord.</p>

<p>Three other general features distinguish this period of transition.
The first is colonization. In the political disturbances
which attend the struggle for power, hundreds of citizens were
forced to change their residence. So we find the mother cities
sending settlers to Italy, to Sicily, to Africa, to the Gulf of Lyons,
to Thrace, and to the islands. In these colonies the real life and
vigor of Hellas show themselves at this stage more than in the
mother states. It is in Sicily, on the coast of Magna Gr&aelig;cia, on
the seaboard of Asia Minor, in the islands of the &AElig;gean, that the
first poets and philosophers and historians of Greece appear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Sparta and Athens, destined to become the protagonists of the
real drama of Hellas, are meanwhile silent and apparently inert.
Secondly, this is the age of the Nomothet&aelig;. Thebes receives a
constitution from the Corinthian lovers and law-givers Philolaus
and Diocles. Lycurgus and Solon form the states of Sparta and
Athens. It is not a little wonderful to think of these three great
cities, successively the leaders of historic Hellas, submitting to the
intellect each of its own lawgiver, taking shape beneath his hands,
cheerfully accepting and diligently executing his directions. Lastly,
it is in this period that the two chief races of the Greeks&mdash;the
Ionians and the Dorians&mdash;emerge into distinctness. Not only
are Athens and Sparta fashioned to the form which they will afterwards
maintain; but also in the colonies two distinct streams
of thought and feeling begin to flow onward side by side, and to
absorb, each into its own current, those minor rivulets which it
could best appropriate.</p>

<p>What happens to literature in this period of metamorphosis,
expansion, and anarchy? We have seen that Homer covers the
whole of the first period of literature; and in the Homeric poems
we saw that the interests of the present were subordinated to a
splendid picture of the ideal past, that the poet was merged in his
work, that the individual joys and sorrows of the artist remained
unspoken, and that his words were referred immediately to the
Muse. All this is now to be altered. But meanwhile, between
the first and second period, a link is made by Hesiod. In his
<i>Works and Days</i> he still preserves the traditions of the epic.
But we no longer listen to the deeds of gods and heroes; and
though the Muse is invoked, the poet appears before us as a living,
sentient, suffering man. We descend to earth. We are instructed
in the toils and duties of the beings who have to act and endure
upon the prosaic stage of the world, as it exists in the common
light of the present time. Even in Hesiod there has therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
been a change. Homer strung his lyre in the halls of princes
who loved to dwell on the great deeds of their god-descended
ancestors. Hesiod utters a weaker and more subdued note to the
tillers of the ground and the watchers of the seasons. In Homer
we see the radiant heroes expiring with a smile upon their lips as
on the &AElig;ginetan pediment. In Hesiod we hear the low, sad outcry
of humanity. The inner life, the daily loss and profit, the
duties and the cares of men are his concern. Homer, too, was
never analytical. He described the world without raising a single
moral or psychological question. Hesiod poses the eternal problems:
What is the origin and destiny of mankind? Why should
we toil painfully upon the upward path of virtue? How came
the gods to be our tyrants? What is justice? How did evil and
pain and disease begin? After Hesiod the epical impulse ceases.
Poets, indeed, go on writing narrative poems in hexameters. But
the cycle, so called by the Alexandrian critics, produced about
this time, had not innate life enough to survive the wear and tear
of centuries. We have lost the whole series, except in the tragedies
which were composed from their materials. Literature had
passed beyond the stage of the heroic epic. The national ear
demanded other and more varied forms of verse than the hexameter.
Among the Ionians of Asia Minor was developed the pathetic
melody of the elegiac metre, which first apparently was
used to express the emotions of love and sorrow, and afterwards
came to be the vehicle of moral sentiment and all strong feeling.
Callinus and Tyrt&aelig;us adapted the elegy to songs of battle. Solon
consigned his wisdom to its couplets, and used it as a trumpet
for awakening the zeal of Athens against her tyrants. Mimnermus
confined the metre to its more plaintive melodies, and made
it the mouthpiece of lamentations over the fleeting beauty of
youth and the evils of old age. In Theognis the elegy takes
wider scope. He uses it alike for satire and invective, for pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>cept,
for autobiographic grumblings, for political discourses, and
for philosophical apophthegms. Side by side with the elegy arose
the various forms of lyric poetry. The names of Alc&aelig;us and
Sappho, of Alcman, Anacreon, Simonides, Bacchylides, Stesichorus,
Arion, instantly suggest themselves. But it must be borne
in mind that lyric poetry in Greece at a very early period broke
up into two distinct species. The one kind gave expression to
strong personal emotion, and became a safety-valve for perilous
passions; the other was choric and complex in its form; designed
for public festivals and solemn ceremonials, it consisted chiefly of
odes sung in the honor of gods and great men. To the former, or
personal species, belong the lyrics of the Ionian and &AElig;olian families;
to the latter, or more public species, belong the so-called Dorian
odes. Besides the elegy and all the forms of lyric stanza,
the iambic, if not invented in this period, was now adapted of set
purpose to personal satire.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Archilochus is said to have preferred
this metre, as being the closest in its form to common speech,
and therefore suited to his unideal practical invective. From the
lyric dithyrambs of Arion, sung at festivals of Dionysus, and
from the iambic satires of Archilochus, recited at the feasts of
Demeter,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> was to be developed the metrical structure of the drama
in the third period. As yet, it is only among the Dorians of Sicily
and of Megara that we hear of any mimetic shows, and these
of the simplest description.</p>

<p>In this period the first start in the direction of philosophy was
made. The morality which had been implicit in Homer, and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>received a partial development in Hesiod, was condensed in proverbial
couplets by Solon, Theognis, Phocylides, and Simonides.
These couplets formed the starting-points for discussion. Many
of Plato's dialogues turn on sayings of Theognis and Simonides.
Many of the sublimer flights of meditation in Sophocles are expansions
of early gnomes. Even the ethics of Aristotle are indebted
to their wisdom. The ferment of thought produced by
the political struggles of this age tended to sharpen the intellect
and to turn reflection inward. Hence we find that the men who
rose to greatest eminence in state-craft as tyrants or as law-givers
are also to be reckoned among the primitive philosophers of
Greece. The aphorisms of the Seven Sages, two of whom were
Nomothet&aelig;, and several of whom were despots, contain the kernel
of much that is peculiar in Greek thought. It is enough
to mention these: &#956;&#951;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#957;&#903; &#956;&#8051;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#903; &#947;&#957;&#8182;&#952;&#953; &#963;&#949;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8057;&#957;&#903;
&#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8056;&#957; &#947;&#957;&#8182;&#952;&#953;&#903; &#7936;&#957;&#8049;&#947;&#954;&#8131; &#948;' &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8054; &#956;&#8049;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;&mdash;which are the germs
of subsequent systems of ethics, metaphysics, and theories of art.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Solon, as a patriot, a modeller of the Athenian constitution, an
elegiac poet, one of the Seven Sages, and the representative of
Greece at the court of Cr&#339;sus, may be chosen as the one most
eminent man in a period when literature and thought and politics
were, to a remarkable extent, combined in single individuals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile philosophy began to flourish in more definite shape
among the colonists of Asia Minor, Italy, and Sicily. The criticism
of the Theogony of Hesiod led the Ionian thinkers&mdash;Thales,
Anaximenes, Anaximander, Heraclitus&mdash;to evolve separate answers
to the question of the origin of the universe. The problem of
the physical &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;, or starting-point, of the world occupied their
attention. Some more scientific theory of existence than mythology
afforded was imperatively demanded. The same spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>criticism, the same demand for accuracy, gave birth to history.
The Theogony of Hesiod and the Homeric version of the Trojan
war, together with the genealogies of the heroes, were reduced to
simple statements of fact, stripped of their artistic trappings, and
rationalized after a rude and simple fashion by the annalists of
Asia Minor. This zeal for greater rigor of thought was instrumental
in developing a new vehicle of language. The time had
come at length for separation from poetry, for the creation of a
prose style which should correspond in accuracy to the logical necessity
of exact thinking. Prose accordingly was elaborated with
infinite difficulty by these first speculators from the elements of
common speech. It was a great epoch in the history of European
culture when men ceased to produce their thoughts in the
fixed cadences of verse, and consigned them to the more elastic
periods of prose. Heraclitus of Ephesus was the first who
achieved a notable success in this new and difficult art. He
for his pains received the title of &#8001; &#963;&#954;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8057;&#962;, the obscure&mdash;so
strange and novel did the language of science seem to minds accustomed
hitherto to nothing but metre. Yet even after his date
philosophy of the deepest species was still conveyed in verse.
The Eleatic metaphysicians Xenophanes and Parmenides&mdash;Xenophanes,
who dared to criticise the anthropomorphism of the
Greek Pantheon, and Parmenides, who gave utterance to the word
of Greek ontology, &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;, or being, which may be significantly
contrasted with the Hebrew I am&mdash;wrote long poems in which they
invoked the Muse, and dragged the hexameter along the pathway
of their argument upon the entities, like a pompous sacrificial
vestment. Empedocles of Agrigentum, to whom we owe the
rough-and-ready theory of the four elements, cadenced his great
work on Nature in the same sonorous verse, and interspersed his
speculations on the cycles of the universe with passages of brilliant
eloquence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the second period is marked alike by changes in politics
and society, and by a revolution in the spirit of literature. The
old Homeric monarchies are broken up. Oligarchies and tyrannies
take their place. To the anarchy and unrest of transition
succeeds the demand for constitutional order. The colonies are
founded, and contain the very pith of Hellas at this epoch: of
all the great names we have mentioned, only Solon and Theognis
belong to Central Greece. The Homeric epos has become obsolete.
In its stead we have the greatest possible variety of literary
forms. The elegiac poetry of morality and war and love; the
lyrical poetry of personal feeling and of public ceremonial; the
philosophical poetry of metaphysics and mysticism; the iambic,
with its satire; prose, in its adaptation to new science and a more
accurate historical investigation&mdash;are all built up upon the ruins
of the epic. What is most prominent in the spirit of this second
period is the emergence of private interests and individual activities.
No dreams of a golden past now occupy the minds of men.
No gods or heroes fill the canvas of the poet. Man, his daily life,
his most crying necessities, his deepest problems, his loves and
sorrows, his friendships, his social relations, his civic duties&mdash;these
are the theme of poetry. Now for the first time in Europe a man
tells his own hopes and fears, and expects the world to listen.
Sappho simply sings her love; Archilochus, his hatred; Theognis,
his wrongs; Mimnermus, his <i>ennui</i>; Alc&aelig;us, his misfortunes;
Anacreon, his pleasure of the hour; and their songs find an echo
in all hearts. The individual and the present have triumphed
over the ideal and the past. Finally, it should be added that the
chief contributions to the culture of the fine arts in this period
are architecture, which is carried to perfection; music, which receives
elaborate form in the lyric of the Dorian order; and sculpture,
which appears as yet but rudimentary upon the pediments
of the temples of &AElig;gina and Selinus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Our third period embraces the supremacy of Athens from the
end of the Persian to the end of the Peloponnesian war. It was
the struggle with Xerxes which developed all the latent energies
of the Greeks, which intensified their national existence, and which
secured for Athens, as the central power on which the scattered
forces of the race converged, the intellectual dictatorship of Hellas.
No contest equals for interest and for importance this contest
of the Greeks with the Persians. It was a struggle of spiritual
energy against brute force, of liberty against oppression, of
intellectual freedom against superstitious ignorance, of civilization
against barbarism. The whole fate of humanity hung trembling
in the scales at Marathon, at Salamis, at Plat&aelig;a. On the one side
were ranged the hordes of Asia&mdash;tribe after tribe, legion upon
legion, myriad by myriad&mdash;under their generals and princes. On
the other side stood forth a band of athletes, of Greek citizens,
each one himself a prince and general. The countless masses of
the herd-like Persian host were opposed to a handful of resolute
men in whom the force of the spirit of the world was concentrated.
The triumph of the Greeks was the triumph of the spirit,
of the intellect of man, of light-dispersing darkness, of energy repelling
a dead weight of matter. Other nations have shown a
temper as heroic as the Greeks. The Dutch, for instance, in their
resistance against Philip, or the Swiss in their antagonism to Burgundy
and Austria. But in no other single instance has heroism
been exerted on so large a scale, in such a fateful contest for the
benefit of mankind at large. Had the Dutch, for example, been
quelled by Spain, or the Swiss been crushed by the House of
Hapsburg, the world could have survived the loss of these athletic
nations. There were other mighty peoples who held the torch
of liberty and of the spirit, and who were ready to carry it onward
in the race. But if Persia had overwhelmed the Greeks
upon the plains of Marathon or in the straits of Salamis, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
torch of spiritual liberty would have been extinguished. There
was no runner in the race to catch it up from the dying hands of
Hellas, and to bear it forward for the future age. No; this contest
of the Greeks with Persia was the one supreme battle of
history; and to the triumph of the Greeks we owe whatever is
most great and glorious in the subsequent achievements of the
human race.</p>

<p>Athens rose to her full height in this duel. She bore the brunt
of Marathon alone. Her generals decided the sea-fight of Salamis.
For the Spartans it remained to defeat Mardonius at Plat&aelig;a.
Consequently the olive-wreath of this more than Olympian
victory crowned Athens. Athens was recognized as Saviour and
Queen of Hellas. And Athens, who had fought the battle of the
spirit&mdash;by spirit we mean the greatness of the soul, liberty, intelligence,
civilization, culture&mdash;everything which raises men above
brutes and slaves, and makes them free beneath the arch of heaven&mdash;Athens,
who had fought and won this battle of the spirit, became
immediately the recognized impersonation of the spirit itself.
Whatever was superb in human nature found its natural
home and sphere in Athens. We hear no more of the colonies.
All great works of art and literature now are produced in Athens.
It is to Athens that the sages come to teach and to be taught.
Anaxagoras, Socrates, Plato, the three masters of philosophy in
this third period, are Athenians. It is, however, noticeable and
significant that Anaxagoras, who forms a link between the philosophy
of the second and third period, is a native of Clazomen&aelig;,
though the thirty years of his active life are spent at Athens.
These thinkers introduce into speculation a new element. Instead
of inquiries into the factors of the physical world or of ontological
theorizing, they approach all problems which involve the activities
of the human soul&mdash;the presence in the universe of a controlling
spirit. Anaxagoras issues the famous apophthegm: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;
&#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;, "intelligence disposes all things in the world."
Socrates founds his ethical investigation upon the Delphian precept:
&#947;&#957;&#8182;&#952;&#953; &#963;&#949;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8057;&#957;; or, "the proper study of mankind is man."
Plato, who belongs chronologically to the fourth period, but who
may here be mentioned in connection with the great men of the
third, as synthesizing all the previous speculations of the Greeks,
ascends to the conception of an ideal existence which unites truth,
beauty, and goodness in one scheme of universal order.</p>

<p>At the same time Greek art rises to its height of full maturity.
Ictinus designs the Parthenon, and Mnesicles the Propyl&aelig;a; Pheidias
completes the development of sculpture in his statue of
Athene, his pediment and friezes of the Parthenon, his chryselephantine
image of Zeus at Olympia, his marble Nemesis upon the
plain of Marathon. These were the ultimate, consummate achievements
of the sculptor's skill; the absolute standards of what the
statuary in Greece could do. Nothing remained to be added.
Subsequent progression&mdash;for a progression there was in the work
of Praxiteles&mdash;was a deflection from the pure and perfect type.</p>

<p>Poetry, in the same way, receives incomparable treatment at
the hands of the great dramatists. As the epic of Homer contained
implicitly all forms of poetry, so did the Athenian drama
consciously unite them in one supreme work of art. The energies
aroused by the Persian war had made action and the delineation
of action of prime importance to the Greeks. We no longer find
the poets giving expression to merely personal feeling, or uttering
wise saws and moral precepts, as in the second period. Human
emotion is indeed their theme; but it is the phases of passion in
living, acting, and conflicting personalities which the drama undertakes
to depict. Ethical philosophy is more than ever substantive
in verse; but its lessons are set forth by example and not
by precept&mdash;they animate the conduct of whole trilogies. The
awakened activity of Hellas at this period produced the first great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
drama of Europe, as the Reformation in England produced the
second. The Greek drama being essentially religious, the tragedians
ascended to mythology for their materials. Homer is dismembered,
and his episodes or allusions, together with the substance
of the Cyclic poems, supply the dramatist with plots. But
notice the difference between Homer and &AElig;schylus, the epic and
the drama. In the latter we find no merely external delineation
of mythical history. The legends are used as outlines to be filled
in with living and eternally important details. The heroes are
not interesting merely as heroes, but as the types and patterns of
human nature; as representatives on a gigantic scale of that humanity
which is common to all men in all ages, and as subject to
the destinies which control all human affairs. Mythology has thus
become the text-book of life, interpreted by the philosophical
consciousness. With the names of &AElig;schylus, Sophocles, Euripides,
must be coupled that of Aristophanes. His comedy is a peculiarly
Athenian product&mdash;the strongest mixture of paradox and
irony and broad buffoonery and splendid poetry, designed to serve
a serious aim, the world has ever seen. Here the many-sided,
flashing genius of the Ionian race appears in all its subtlety, variety,
suppleness, and strength. The free spirit of Athens runs
riot and proclaims its liberty by license in the prodigious saturnalia
of the wit of Aristophanes.</p>

<p>It remains to be added that to this period belong the histories
of Herodotus, the Halicarnassean by birth, who went to Thurii
as colonist from Athens, and of Thucydides, the Athenian general;
the lyrics of Pindar the Theban, who was made the public guest
of Athens; the eloquence of Pericles, and the wit of Aspasia.
This brief enumeration suffices to show that in the third period of
Greek literature was contained whatever is most splendid in the
achievements of the genius of the Greeks, and that all these triumphs
converged and were centred upon Athens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The public events of this period are summed up in the struggle
for supremacy between Athens and Sparta. The race which had
shown itself capable of united action against the common foe
now develops within itself two antagonistic and mutually exclusive
principles. The age of the despots is past. The flowering-time
of the colonies is over. The stone of Tantalus in Persia has
been removed from Hellas. But it remains for Sparta and Athens
to fight out the duel of Dorian against Ionian prejudices, of oligarchy
against democracy. Both states have received their definite
stamp, or permanent &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962;&mdash;Sparta from semi-mythical Lycurgus;
Athens from Solon, Cleisthenes, and Pericles. Their war is
the warfare of the powers of the sea with the powers of the land,
of Conservatives with Liberals, of the rigid principle of established
order with the expansive spirit of intellectual and artistic freedom.
What is called the Peloponnesian war&mdash;that internecine struggle
of the Greeks&mdash;is the historical outcome of this deep-seated antagonism.
And the greatest historical narrative in the world&mdash;that
of Thucydides&mdash;is its record. To dwell upon the events of
this war would be superfluous. Athens uniformly exhibits herself
as a dazzling, brilliant, impatient power, led astray by the desire of
novelty, and the intoxicating sense of force in freedom. Sparta
proceeds slowly, coldly, cautiously; secures her steps; acts on the
defensive; spends no strength in vain; is timid, tentative, and
economical of energy; but at the decisive moment she steps in
and crushes her antagonist. Deluded by the wandering fire of
the inspiration of Alcibiades, the Athenians venture to abandon
the policy of Pericles and to contemplate the conquest of Syracuse.
A dream of gigantic empire, in harmony with their expansive
spirit, but inconsistent with the very conditions of vitality in
a Greek state, floated before their imaginations. In attempting
to execute it, they overreached themselves and fell a prey to Sparta.
With the fall of Athens faded the real beauty and grandeur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of Greece. Athens had incarnated that ideal of loveliness and
sublimity. During her days of prosperity she had expressed it
in superb works of art and literature, and in the splendid life of
a free people governed solely by their own intelligence. Sparta
was strong to destroy this life, to extinguish this light of culture.
But to do more she had no strength. Stiffened in her narrow
rules of discipline, she was utterly unable to sustain the spiritual
vitality of Hellas, or to carry its still vigorous energy into new
spheres. It remained for aliens to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Just before passing to the fourth period of comparative decline,
we may halt a moment to contemplate the man who represents
this age of full maturity. Pericles, called half in derision by the
comic poets the Zeus of Athens, called afterwards, with reverence,
by Plutarch, the Olympian&mdash;Pericles expresses in himself the
spirit of this age. He is the typical Athenian who governed
Athens during the years in which Athens governed Greece, who
formed the taste of the Athenians at the time when they were
educating the world by the production of immortal works of
beauty. We have seen that the conquest of the Persians was the
triumph of the spirit, and that after the conquest the spirit of
humanity found itself for the first time absolutely and consciously
free in Athens. This spirit was, so to speak, incarnated in
Pericles. The Greek genius was made flesh in him, and dwelt at
Athens. In obedience to its dictates, he extended the political
liberties of the Athenians to the utmost, while he controlled those
liberties with the laws of his own reason. In obedience to the
same spirit, he expended the treasures of the Ionian League upon
the public works which formed the subsequent glory of Hellas,
and made her august even in humiliation. "That," says Plutarch,
"which now is Greece's only evidence that the power she boasts
of and her ancient wealth are no romance or idle story was his
construction of the public and sacred buildings." It was, again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
by the same inspiration that Pericles divined the true ideal of the
Athenian commonwealth. In the Funeral Oration he says: "We
love the beautiful, but without ostentation or extravagance; we
philosophize without being seduced into effeminacy; we are bold
and daring, but this energy in action does not prevent us from
giving to ourselves a strict account of what we undertake. Among
other nations, on the contrary, martial courage has its foundation
in deficiency of culture. We know best how to distinguish between
the agreeable and the irksome; notwithstanding which we
do not shrink from perils." In this panegyric of the national
character, Pericles has rightly expressed the real spirit of Athens
as distinguished from Sparta. The courage and activity of the
Athenians were the result of open-eyed wisdom, and not of mere
gymnastic training. Athens knew that the arts of life and the
pleasures of the intellect were superior to merely physical exercises,
to drill, and to discipline.</p>

<p>While fixing our thoughts upon Pericles as the exponent of
the mature spirit of free Hellas, we owe some attention to his
master, the great Anaxagoras, who first made reason play the
chief part in the scheme of the universe. Of the relations of
Anaxagoras to his pupil Pericles, this is what Plutarch tells us:
"He that saw most of Pericles, and furnished him most especially
with a weight and grandeur of sense superior to all arts of
popularity, and in general gave him his elevation and sublimity of
purpose and of character, was Anaxagoras of Clazomen&aelig;, whom
the men of those times called by the name of Nous&mdash;that is, mind
or intelligence; whether in admiration of the great and extraordinary
gift he displayed for the science of nature, or because he
was the first of the philosophers who did not refer the first ordering
of the world to fortune or chance, nor to necessity or compulsion,
but to a pure, unadulterated intelligence, which in all
other existing mixed and compound things acts as a principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
discrimination, and of combination of like with like." Thus we
may say, without mysticism, that at the very moment in history
when the intelligence of mankind attained to freedom, there arose
a philosopher in Anaxagoras to proclaim the freedom and absolute
supremacy of intelligence in the universe; and a ruler in Pericles
to carry into action the laws of that intelligence, and to govern
the most uncontrollably free of nations by reason. When Pericles
died, Athens lost her Zeus, her head, her real king. She was
left a prey to parties, to demagogues, to the cold encroaching
policy of Sparta. But Pericles had lived long enough to secure
the immortality of what was greatest in his city&mdash;to make of
Athens in her beauty "a joy forever."</p>

<p>"If the army of Nicias had not been defeated under the walls
of Syracuse; if the Athenians had, acquiring Sicily, held the
balance between Rome and Carthage, sent garrisons to the Greek
colonies in the south of Italy, Rome might have been all that its
intellectual condition entitled it to be, a tributary, not the conqueror,
of Greece; the Macedonian power would never have attained
to the dictatorship of the civilized states of the world."
Such is the exclamation of Shelley over the fall of Athens. But,
according to the Greek proverb, to desire impossibilities&mdash;in the
past as in the present&mdash;is a sickness of the soul. No Greek state
could have maintained its &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; while it ruled a foreign empire;
nor is the right to govern measured by merely intellectual capacity.
The work of Greece was essentially spiritual and not
political. The chief sign of weakness which meets us in the
fourth period is in the region of politics. After the humiliation
of Athens, Sparta assumed the leadership of Greece. But she
shamefully misused her power by betraying the Greek cities of
Asia to the Persians, while her generals and harmosts made use
of their authority for the indulgence of their private vices. Nothing
in the previous training of the Spartan race fitted them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the control of nations with whose more liberal institutions and
refined manners they could not sympathize. Their tyranny
proved insupportable, and was at last reduced to the dust by the
Thebans under Pelopidas and Epaminondas. But Thebes had
neither the wealth nor the vigor to administer the government of
Hellas. Therefore the Greek states fell into a chaos of discord,
without leadership, without a generous spirit of mutual confidence
and aid; while at the same time the power of the Macedonian
kingdom was rapidly increasing under the control of Philip.
An occasion offered itself to Philip for interfering in the
Greek affairs. From that moment forward forever the cities of
Greece became the fiefs of foreign despots. The occasion in
question was a great one. The Phocians had plundered the Delphian
temple, and none of the Greeks were strong enough to punish
them. The act of the Phocians was parricidal in its sacrilege,
suicidal in short-sightedness. Defiling the altar of the ancestral
god, on whose oracles the states had hitherto depended for counsel,
and destroying, with the sanctity of Delphi, the sacred symbol
of Greek national existence, they abandoned themselves to
desecration and dishonor. With as little impunity could a king
of Judah have robbed the temple and invaded the holiest of holies.
But neither Spartans nor Athenians nor yet Thebans arose
to avenge the affront offered to their common nationality. The
whole of Greece proper lay paralyzed, and the foreigner stepped
in&mdash;Philip, whom in their pride they had hitherto called the Barbarian.
He took up the cause of Ph&#339;bus and punished the children
of the Delphian god for their impiety. It was clearly proved
to the states of Hellas that their independence was at an end.
They submitted. Greece became the passive spectator of the
deeds of Macedonia. Hellas, who had been the hero, was now
the chorus. It was Alexander of Macedon who played the part
of Achilles in her future drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>One man vindicated the spirit of Greek freedom against this
despotism. The genius of Athens, militant once more, but destined
not to triumph, incarnates itself in Demosthenes. By dint
of eloquence and weight of character he strives to stem the tide
of dissolution. But it is in vain. His orations remain as the
monuments of a valiant but ineffectual resistance. The old intelligence
of Athens shines, nay, fulminates, in these tremendous
periods; but it is no longer intelligence combined with power.
The sceptre of empire has passed from the hands of the Athenians.</p>

<p>Still, though the states of Greece are humiliated, though we
hear no more of Ionians and Dorians, but only of Macedonians,
yet the real force of the Greek race is by no means exhausted in
this fourth period. On the contrary, their practical work in the
world is just beginning. Under the guidance of Alexander, the
Greek spirit conquers and attempts to civilize the East. The
parallel between Alexander and Achilles, as before hinted, is more
than accidental. Trained in the study of Homer as we are in the
study of the Bible, he compared his destinies with those of the
great hero, and formed himself upon the type of Pelides. At
Troy he pays peculiar reverence to the tomb of Patroclus. He
celebrates Heph&aelig;stion's death with Homeric games and pyres up-piled
to heaven. He carries Homer with him on war-marches,
and consults the <i>Iliad</i> on occasions of doubt. Alexander's purpose
was to fight out to the end the fight begun by Achilles between
West and East, and to avenge Greece for the injuries of
Asia. But it was not a merely military conquest which he executed.
Battles were the means to higher ends. Alexander sought
to subject the world to the Greek spirit, to stamp the customs,
the thoughts, the language, and the culture of the Greeks upon
surrounding nations. Poets and philosophers accompanied his
armies. In the deserts of Bactria and Syria and Libya he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>ed
Greek cities. During the few years of his short life he not
only swept those continents, but he effaced the past and inaugurated
a new state of things throughout them; so that, in subsequent
years, when the Romans, themselves refined by contact with
the Greeks, advanced to take possession of those territories, they
found their work half done. The alchemizing touch of the Greek
genius had transformed languages, cities, constitutions, customs,
nay, religions also, to its own likeness. This fourth period, a
period of transition from maturity to decay, is the period of
Alexander. In it the Greek spirit, which had been gathering
strength through so many generations, poured itself abroad over
the world. What it lost in intensity and splendor, it gained in
extension. It was impossible, even for Greeks, while thus impressing
their civilization on the whole earth, to go on increasing
in the beauty of their life and art at home.</p>

<p>Some of the greatest names in art, philosophy, and literature
still belong to this fourth period. The chief of all is Aristotle,
<i>il maestro di color che sanno</i>, the absorber of all previous and contemporary
knowledge into one coherent system, the legislator for
the human intellect through eighteen centuries after his death.
It is worth observing that Aristotle, unlike Socrates and Plato, is
not a citizen of Athens, but of the small Thracian town Stageira.
Thus, at the moment when philosophy lost its essentially Hellenic
character and became cosmopolitan in Aristotle, the mantle devolved
upon an alien. Again Aristotle was the tutor of Alexander.
The two greatest men of the fourth period are thus brought
into the closest relations. In pure literature the most eminent
productions of this period are the orations of &AElig;schines, Demosthenes,
Isocrates, and the comedies of Menander. It is not a
little significant that we should have retained no authentic fragment
of the speeches of Pericles&mdash;except in so far as we may
trust Thucydides&mdash;while the studied rhetoric of these politically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
far less important orators should have been so copiously preserved.
The reign of mere talk was imminent. Oratory was coming to
be studied as an art, and practised, not as a potent instrument in
politics, but as an end in itself. Men were beginning to think
more of how they spoke than of what they might achieve by
speaking. Besides, the whole Athenian nation, as dikasts and as
ecclesiasts, were interested in rhetoric. The first masters of eloquence
considered as a fine art were therefore idolized. Demosthenes,
&AElig;schines, Isocrates, combined the fire of vehement partisans
and impassioned politicians with the consummate skill of
professional speech-makers. After their days rhetoric in Greece
became a matter of frigid display&mdash;an &#7936;&#947;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#945; &#7952;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8049;&#967;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#945;.
In the comedies of Menander, as far as we may judge of them
from fragments and critiques, and from their Latin copies, a very
noticeable change in the spirit of literature is apparent. The so-called
New Comedy, of which he was the representative, is the
product of a meditative and inactive age. The great concerns of
the world, and of human life seen in its profoundest depth, which
formed the staple of Aristophanes, have been abandoned. We
are brought close to domesticities: the events of common life
occupy the stage of Menander. The audience of Aristophanes
listened with avidity to comedies of which politics upon the
grandest scale were the substance. Menander invited his Athenians
to the intrigues of young men, slaves, and hetairai, at warfare
with niggardly parents. Athens has ceased to be an empress.
She has become a garrulous housewife. She contents
herself with studious analysis and refined amusements&mdash;still splendid
with intelligence and dignified with wisdom, but not weighty
with the consciousness of power, nor throbbing with the pulses
of superabundant youthfulness and vigor.</p>

<p>In the fine arts this fourth period was still inventive. Under
Alexander painting, which had received its Hellenic character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
from Polygnotus and Zeuxis, continued to flourish with Apelles.
Indeed, it may be fairly said that while art in the heroic period
was confined to the perfecting of the human body, in the second
period it produced architecture, in the third sculpture, and in the
fourth painting&mdash;this being apparently the natural order of progression
in the evolution of the fine arts. Lysippus, meanwhile,
worthily represents the craft of the statuary in Alexander's age;
while the coins and gems of this time show that the glyptic and
numismatic arts were at their zenith of technical perfection. Of
Greek music, in the absence of all sure information, it is difficult
to speak. Yet it is probable that the age of Alexander witnessed
a new and more complex development of orchestral music. We
hear of vast symphonies performed at the Macedonian court.
Nor is this inconsistent with what we know about the history of
art; for music attains independence, ceases to be the handmaid
of poetry or dancing, only in an age of intellectual reflectiveness.
When nations have expressed themselves in the more obvious and
external arts, they seek through harmonies and melodies to give
form to their emotions.</p>

<p>The fifth, last, and longest period is one of decline and decay.
But these words must be used with qualification when we speak
of a people like the Greeks. What is meant is, that the Greeks
never recovered their national vigor or produced men so great as
those whom we have hitherto been mentioning. The Macedonian
empire prepared the way for the Roman: Hellenic civilization
put on the garb of servitude to Rome and to Christianity. Henceforth
we must not look to Greece proper for the more eminent
achievements of the still surviving spirit of the Greeks. Greek
culture in its decadence has become the heritage of the whole
world. Syrians, Egyptians, Phrygians, Romans, carry on the tradition
inherited from Athens. Hellas is less a nation now than
an intellectual commonwealth, a society of culture holding various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
races in communion. The spiritual republic established thus by
the Greek genius prepares the way for Christian brotherhood:
the liberty of the children of the Muses leads onward to the freedom
of the sons of God.</p>

<p>In this period, the chief centres are first Alexandria and Athens,
then Rome and Byzantium. The real successors of Alexander
were his generals. But the only dynasty founded by them which
rises into eminence by its protection of the arts and literature was
the Ptolemaic. At Alexandria, under the Ptolemies, libraries were
formed and sciences were studied. Euclid the geometer, Aratus
the astronomer, Ptolemy the cosmographer, add lustre to the
golden age of Alexandrian culture. Callimachus at the same time
leads a tribe of learned poets and erudite men of letters. Dramas
meant to be read, like Lycophron's <i>Cassandra</i>; epics composed
in the study, like the <i>Argonautica</i> of Apollonius Rhodius, form
the diversion of the educated world. Meanwhile the whole genus
of parasitic <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i> begin to flourish: grammarians, who settle
and elucidate texts with infinite labor and some skill; sophists
and rhetoricians, whose purpose in life it is to adorn imaginary
subjects and to defend problematical theses with conceits of the
fancy and ingenious subtleties of reasoning. A young man writing
to his mistress, a dinner-seeker who has failed to get an invitation,
Themistocles at the Persian court, celebrated statues, philosophical
puzzles&mdash;everything that can be wordily elaborated is
grist for their mill. The art of writing without having anything
particular to say, the sister art of quarrying the thoughts of other
people and setting them in elaborate prolixities of style, are
brought to perfection. At the same time, side by side with these
literary moths and woodlice, are the more industrious ants&mdash;the
collectors of anecdotes, compilers of biographies, recorders of
quotations, composers of all sorts of commonplace books, students
of the paste-brush and scissors sort, to whom we owe much for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the preservation of scraps of otherwise lost treasures. Into such
mechanical and frigid channels has the life of literature passed.
Literature is no longer an integral part of the national existence,
but a form of polite amusement. The genius of Hellas has nothing
better to do than to potter about like a <i>dilettante</i> among her
treasures.</p>

<p>The only true poets of this period are the Sicilian idyllists.
Over the waning day of Greek poetry Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus
cast the sunset hues of their excessive beauty. Genuine and
exquisite is their inspiration; pure, sincere, and true is their execution.
Yet we agree with Shelley, who compares their perfume
to "the odor of the tuberose, which overcomes and sickens the
spirit with excess of sweetness." In the same way the erotic epigrammatists,
though many of them genuine poets, especially the
exquisite Meleager of Gadara, in the very perfection of their peculiar
quality of genius offer an unmistakable sign of decay. It
is the fashion among a certain class of modern critics to extol the
art of decadence, to praise the hectic hues of consumption, and
even the dull livors of corruption, above the roses and the lilies
of health. Let them peruse the epigrams of Meleager and of
Straton. Of beauty in decay sufficient splendors may be found
there.</p>

<p>While Alexandria was thus carrying the poetic tradition of
Hellas to its extremity in the idyl and the epigram&mdash;carving
cherrystones after the sculptor's mallet had been laid aside&mdash;and
was continuing the criticism which had been set on foot by Aristotle,
Athens persisted in her function of educating Europe. She
remained a sort of university, in which the doctrines of Plato
and Aristotle were adequately developed, though not in the most
comprehensive spirit, by a crowd of peripatetic and academic
sages, and where the founders of the Epicurean and Stoic schools
gave a new direction to thought. It was during the first vigor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of the Epicurean and Stoic teaching that the spirit of Hellas came
into contact with the spirit of Rome. Hence Lucretius, Cicero,
the satirists&mdash;whatever, in fact, Rome may boast of philosophy,
retains the tincture of the ethics of her schoolmasters. Rome, as
Virgil proudly said, was called to govern&mdash;not to write poems or
carve statues, but to quell the proud and spare the abject. Still
she caught, to some extent, the &aelig;sthetic manners of her captive.
Consequently, long after the complete political ascendency of
Rome was an established fact, and geographical Greece had become
an insignificant province, the Hellenic spirit led the world.
And some of its latest products are still dazzling in beauty, marvellous
in ingenuity, Titanic in force. A few names selected from
the list of Gr&aelig;co-Roman authors will be more impressive than
much description. Plutarch of Ch&aelig;ronea, in the first century,
the author of the great biographies; Lucian, the Syrian, in the
second century, the master of irony and graceful dialogue and
delicate description; Epictetus, the Phrygian slave, in the second
century, who taught the latest form of Stoicism to the Romans,
and had for his successor Marcus Aurelius; Philostratus of Lemnos,
the rhetorician and author of the life of Apollonius; Plotinus,
Porphyrius, and Proclus, the revivers of Platonic philosophy
under a new form of mysticism at Alexandria during the third
and fourth centuries; Longinus, the critic, who adorned Palmyra
in the third century;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Heliodorus of Emesa, Achilles Tatius, Longus,
Mus&aelig;us, the erotic novelists and poets of the fourth and fifth
centuries&mdash;these, not to mention the Christian fathers, are a few
of the great men whom Greece produced in this last period. But
now notice how miscellaneous in nationality and in pursuit they
are. One only is a Greek of the old stock&mdash;Plutarch, the B&#339;otian.
One is a slave from Phrygia. Another is a Roman emperor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>A fourth is a native of the desert city of Tadmor. Two
are Syrians. One is a Greek of the &AElig;gean. Another is an
Egyptian. From this we may see how the genius of the Greeks
had been spread abroad to embrace all lands. No fact better
illustrates the complete leavening of the world by their spirit.</p>

<p>But considering that this fifth period may be said to cover six
centuries, from the death of Alexander to about 300 after Christ&mdash;for
why should we continue our computation into the dreary
regions of Byzantine dulness?&mdash;it must be confessed that it is
sterile in productiveness and inferior in the quality of its crop to
any of the previous periods. Subtle and beautiful is the genius
of Hellas still, because it <i>is</i> Greek; strong and stern it is in part,
because it has been grafted on the Roman character; its fascinations
and compulsions are powerful enough to bend the metaphysics
of the Christian faith. Yet, after all, it is but a shadow
of its own self.</p>

<p>After the end of the fourth century the iconoclastic zeal and
piety of the Christians put an end practically to Greek art and
literature. Christianity was at that time the superior force in the
world; and though Clement of Alexandria contended for an amicable
treaty of peace between Greek culture and the new creed,
though the two Gregories and Basil were, to use the words of
Gibbon, "distinguished above all their contemporaries by the rare
union of profane eloquence and orthodox piety," though the
bishops of the Church were selected from the ranks of scholars
trained by Libanius and other Greek sophists, yet the spirit of
Christianity proved fatal to the spirit of Greek art. Early in the
fifth century the Christian rabble at Alexandria, under the inspiration
of their ferocious despot Cyril, tore in pieces Hypatia, the
last incarnation of the dying beauty of the Greeks. She had
turned her eye backward to Homer and to Plato, dreaming that
haply even yet the gods of Hellas might assert their power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
resume the government of the world, and that the wisdom of
Athens might supplant the folly of Jerusalem. But it was a vain
and idle dream. The genius of Greece was effete. Christianity
was pregnant with the medi&aelig;val and the modern world. In violence
and bloodshed the Gospel triumphed. This rending in
pieces of the past, this breaking-down of temples and withering
of illusions, was no doubt necessary. New wine cannot be poured
into old bottles. No cycle succeeds another cycle in human affairs
without convulsions and revolutions that rouse the passions
of humanity. It is thus that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">God fulfils himself in many ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet even in this last dire struggle of the spirit of pagan art with
the spirit of Christian faith, when beauty had become an abomination
in the eyes of the Holiest, on the ruins, as it were, of the
desecrated fanes of Hellas, weeds lovely in their rankness flourished.
While Cyril's mobs were dismembering Hypatia, the erotic
novelists went on writing about Daphnis, and Mus&aelig;us sang
the lamentable death of Leander. Nonnus was perfecting a new
and more polished form of the hexameter. These were the last
notes of Greek poetry. In these faint and too melodious strains
the Muse took final farewell of her beloved Hellas. And when,
after the lapse of a thousand years, the world awoke upon the
ruins of the past, these were among the first melodies which
caught its ear. One of the three first Greek books issued from
the Aldine press about the year 1493, and called by Aldus the
"precursors," was the poem of Hero and Leander. It was reprinted
at Paris in 1507 by De Gourmont, at Alcala in Spain in
1514, and at Cologne in 1517 by Hirschhorn. Our Marlowe in
the sixteenth century translated Mus&aelig;us. The French Amyot
translated Longus, and bequeathed to his nation a voluminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
literature of pastorals founded upon the tale of Chloe. Tasso
and Guarini, in Italy, caught the same strain; so that the accents
of the modern Renaissance were an echo of the last utterances
of dying Greece. The golden age of pastoral innocence, the
<i>bell' et&agrave; dell' oro</i>, of which the Alexandrians had been dreaming
in the midst of their effete and decaying civilization, fascinated
the imagination of our immediate ancestors, when, three centuries
ago, they found the sun of art and beauty shining in the heavens,
new worlds to conquer, and indefinite expansions of the spirit to
be realized.</p>

<p>It has been remarked with justice that, when we use the word
mythology, we are too apt to think of a Pantheon, of a well-defined
hierarchy of gods and demigods and heroes, all fabulous
indeed, but all arranged in one coherent system. This conception
of Greek mythology arises partly from the fact that we learn to
know it in dictionaries, compiled from the works of authors who
lived long after the age in which myths were produced, and partly
from the fact that the conditions under which myth-making
was a possibility are so far removed from us as to be almost unintelligible.
Yet there is some truth in what, upon the whole, is an
erroneous view. Although the Greek myths, in their origin, were
not a well-digested system, still they formed a complete body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
national thought, on which the intelligence of the Greek race, in
its art and its religion, was continually working, until it took the
final form in which we have it in our dictionaries. What remained
in the Pantheon of Apollodorus and Hyginus, remained
there by no freak of accident. What was omitted by Homer and
by Hesiod was omitted by no operation of blind chance. The
spirit of the Greeks was concerned in the purification and the
preservation of their myths, and the unity of that spirit constitutes
the unity of their mythology.</p>

<p>Two great poets gave to Greek mythology the form which it
maintained in the historic period. Herodotus says that "Homer
and Hesiod named the gods, and settled their genealogies for the
Hellenes." What this means is, that at a certain prehistoric
epoch, the epoch of epic poetry, mythology had passed from the
primitive and fluid state, and had become the subject-matter of
the arts. Between the mythop&#339;ic liberty of creation and the
collections of the grammarians was interposed the poetry, the
sculpture, and the religious ritual of the historic Greeks. What
we have to deal with at the present moment is, not mythology as
it appears in art, but the genesis of the myths conceived as a body
of Greek thought and fancy in their infantine or rudimentary
stages.</p>

<p>What was mythology before Homer? How did it come into
existence? How were the Greeks brought to believe that there
was a supreme father of gods and men called Zeus, a wise patroness
of arts and sciences called Pallas, a pure and glorious and far-darting
deity called Ph&#339;bus? There is no one who does not acknowledge
something sublime and beautiful in this part of the
Greek mythology. Even those who do not care to comprehend
the growth of these conceptions admit that the genius of the race
shone with splendor peculiar to itself in their creation.</p>

<p>To this question must be counterpoised another. What are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
we to think about the many repulsive, grotesque, and hideous
elements of Greek mythology&mdash;the incest and adultery of Zeus,
the cannibalism of Kronos, the profligacy of Aphrodite, the cruelty
of Ph&#339;bus? When thought began to be conscious of itself
in Greece these abominations moved the anger of the philosophers.
Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Pindar, and Plato,
in succession, recognized that the mythical fables were incompatible
with the notion of deity, and rejected them forthwith.
Modern students have been so disgusted by the same indecencies
that some of them have abandoned Greek mythology as hopeless,
while others have taken refuge in the extraordinary paradox that
myths are a disease of language. These methods of dealing with
the problem are alike unphilosophical. It is impossible for the
historian to reject what formed the groundwork of religious and
artistic thought in Greece. It is childish to represent the human
mind as a sort of bound Mazeppa, stretched helpless on the wild
horse, Language, which carries it away into the wilderness.</p>

<p>In order to understand the two questions which have been propounded,
we must make a demand upon our imagination, and
endeavor to return, in thought at least, to the conditions of a
people in the mythop&#339;ic age&mdash;the age, that is to say, in which
not only were myths naturally made, but all the thinking of a
nation took the form of myths. We must go back to a time
when there were no written records, when there were no systems
of thought, when language had not been subjected to analysis of
any kind, when abstract notions were unknown, when science had
not begun to exist, when history was impossible, and when the
whole world was a land of miracles. There was no check then
laid upon fancy, because nothing as yet was conceived as thought,
but everything existed as sensation. In this infancy the nation
told itself stories, and believed in them. The same faculties of
the mind which afterwards gave birth to poetry and theology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
philosophy and state-craft, science and history, were now so ill-defined
and merely germinal that they produced but fables. Yet
these faculties were vigorous and vivid. The fables they produced
were infinite in number and variety, beautiful, and so pregnant
with thought under the guise of fancy that long centuries
scarcely sufficed for disengaging all that they contained. In dealing
with Greek mythology it must be remembered that the nation
with whose mythop&#339;ic imagination we are concerned was
the Greek nation.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It had already in itself all Hellas, as the
seed enfolds the plant.</p>

<p>A famous passage in Vico's work <i>Della Metafisica Poetica</i> may
here be paraphrased, in order to make the conditions under which
we must imagine myths to have arisen more intelligible:<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "Poetry,
which was the first form of wisdom, began with a system
of thought, not reasoned or abstract, as ours is now, but felt and
imagined, as was natural in the case of those primitive human
beings who had developed no reasoning faculties, but were all
made up of senses in the highest physical perfection, and of the
most vigorous imaginations. In their total ignorance of causes
they wondered at everything; and their poetry was all divine,
because they ascribed to gods the objects of their wonder, and
thought that beings like themselves, but greater, could alone have
caused them. Thus they were like children whom we notice
taking into their hands inanimate things, and playing and talking
with them as though they were living persons. When thunder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>terrified them, they attributed their own nature to the phenomenon;
and being apt to express their most violent passions
by howls and roarings, they conceived heaven as a vast body,
which gave notice of its anger by lightnings and thunderings.
The whole of nature, in like manner, they imagined to be a vast
animated body, capable of feeling and passion." Vico then proceeds
to point out how difficult it is for us, who, through long
centuries, have removed ourselves as far as possible from the life
of the instincts, senses, and imagination, whose language has become
full of abstract terms, whose conception of the universe
has been formed by science, whose thought is critical and reflective,
and who have been educated in a rational theology, to comprehend
the attitude of primitive humanity in its personifying
stage of thought.</p>

<p>In this childhood of the world, when the Greek myths came
into existence, the sun was called a shepherd, and the clouds were
his sheep; or an archer, and the sunbeams were his arrows. It
was easier then to think of the sea as a husky-voiced and turbulent
old man, whose true form none might clearly know, because
he changed so often and was so secret in his ways, who shook
the earth in his anger, and had the white-maned billows of the
deep for horses, than to form a theory of the tides. The spring
of the year became a beautiful youth, beloved by the whole earth,
or beloved, like Hyacinthus, by the sun, or, like Adonis, by the
queen of beauty, over whom the fate of death was suspended,
and for whose loss annual mourning was made. Such tales the
Greeks told themselves in their youth; and it would be wrong to
suppose that deliberate fiction played any part in their creation.
To conceive of the world thus was natural to the whole race; and
the tales that sprang up formed the substance of their intellectual
activity. Here, then, if anywhere, we watch the process of a people
in its entirety contributing to form a body of imaginative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
thought, projecting itself in a common and unconscious work of
art. Nor will it avail to demur that behind the Greeks there
stretched a dim and distant past, that many of their myths had
already taken shape, to some extent, before the separation of the
Aryan families. That is now an ascertained fact, the bearings
of which will have to be discussed farther on in this chapter.
For the moment it is enough to reply that not the similarities,
but the differences, brought to light by the study of comparative
mythology are important for the historian of each several race.
The raw material of silk may interest the merchant or the man
of science; the artist cares for the manufactured fabric, with its
curious patterns and refulgent hues.</p>

<p>In order further to illustrate the conditions of the mythop&#339;ic
age, a passage from the <i>Dichtung und Wahrheit</i> of Goethe might
be quoted. If it is not a mere fancy to suppose that the individual
lives, to some extent at least, in his own self the life of humanity,
and therefore to conclude that the childhood of the world
can be mirrored in the childhood of a man, a poet like Goethe is
precisely fitted, by the record of his own boyhood, to throw light
upon the early operations of the human mind. For, in one sense
of the term, the mythop&#339;ic faculty never dies with poets. In
their own persons they prolong the youth and adolescence of
the race, retaining the faculty, now lost to nearly all, of looking
on the universe as living. Goethe, then, relates that when he was
at school at Frankfort, he used to invent stories about himself
and the places he frequented, half consciously, and half by a
spontaneous working of his fancy. These stories he told to his
school-fellows so vividly that they accepted them as fact. "It
greatly rejoiced them," he says, "to know that such wonderful
things could befall one of their own playmates; nor was it any
harm that they did not understand how I could find time and
space for such adventures, as they must have been pretty well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
aware of all my comings and goings, and how I was occupied
the whole day." He goes on to recount one of these marvellous
narratives. The scene of it was laid in Frankfort, in a street familiar
to his school-fellows. Down this street, which had a long
blank wall surmounted by trees, he supposed himself to have been
walking one day, and to have found a door in the wall, not noticed
by him on any previous occasion. His curiosity being
aroused, he knocked at the door, and, after some delay, was admitted.
Inside he found a garden full of wonders&mdash;fountains
and fair nymphs, exotic shrubs and quaint old men, magicians,
knights, sylphs, and all the proper furniture of a romance. Goethe's
comrades, the first time that they heard him describe this
enchanted pleasure-ground in glowing terms, already more than
half believed in its existence; "and," says the poet, "each of
them visited alone the place, without confiding it to me or to the
others, and discovered the nut-trees," but none found the door.
Still, they did not disbelieve what Goethe told them, but preferred
to imagine that the magic door had once, at least, been seen by
him, and opened for him only, though it remained invisible and
closed for them. And herein they were literally right, for Goethe
trod an enchanted ground of poetry which few can hope to win.
The story proved so fascinating that he had to tell it over and
over again, always repeating the same order of events, until, he
says, "by the uniformity of the narrative I converted the fable
into truth in the minds of my hearers."</p>

<p>This, then, may be used as an illustration of the mythop&#339;ic
faculty. All that was needed for the growth of myths was creative
mind on the one side and receptive and believing mind on
the other. It did not, probably, require a Goethe to make a myth,
though we may still believe that the greatest and best myths
owed their form to the intervention at some period of unknown
and unacknowledged Goethes. When the logical faculty was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
abeyance, when the critical faculty had not been aroused, when
sympathy was quick, language fertile, fancy exuberant, and belief
sincere, there was nothing to check mythop&#339;try. The nation
had to make the step from boyhood to adolescence before the
impulse ceased. Nor was there any education from without in a
fixed body of systematized knowledge to coerce its freedom.
Forming the first activity of the intellect, it held in solution, as
it were, the rudiments of religion and morality, of psychological
reflection, of politics, geography, and history. Had there been
any one to ask the myth-maker: Who told you this strange tale?
what is your authority for imposing it upon us? he would have
answered: The goddess told me, the divine daughter of memory,
as I walked alone. And this he would sincerely and conscientiously
have believed; and those who heard him would have
given credence to his words; and thus his intuitions became their
intuitions. Creative faculty and credence, insight and sympathy,
two forms of the same as yet scarcely divided operation of the
mind, gave permanence to myths. What the fathers received
they transmitted to their sons. Successive generations dealt
freely with them, moulding and remodelling, within the limits
set upon the genius of the race. Hundreds may have been produced
simultaneously, and among them must have raged a fierce
struggle for existence, so that multitudes perished or were hopelessly
defaced, just as in the animal and vegetable kingdoms whole
species disappear or survive only in fragments and fossils.</p>

<p>It cannot be too often repeated that the power which presided
over the transmission of the myths was the spirit of the people.
An inherent selective instinct in the nation determined which of
them should ultimately survive; and thus a body of legend, truly
national, was formed, in which the nation saw itself reflected.
When, therefore, we say that Greek mythology is Hellenic and
original, we are admitting this unconscious, silent, steady, irresist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>ible
faculty of the mind to fashion gods in its own image, to
come to a knowledge of itself in its divinities, to create a glorified
likeness of all that it admires in its own nature, to deify its truest
and its best, and to invest its thought in an imperishable form of
art. Nor will it here again avail to demur that Zeus was originally
the open sky, Pallas the dawn, Ph&#339;bus and Artemis the sun
and moon. The student of the Greeks accepts this information
placidly and gratefully from the philologer; but he passes immediately
beyond it. For him Zeus, Pallas, Ph&#339;bus, Artemis
are no longer the sky and dawn, the sun and moon. Whatever
their origin may have been, the very mythop&#339;ic process placed
them in quite a different and more important relation to Greek
thought when it handed them over to Hesiod and Homer, to
Pindar and &AElig;schylus, to Pheidias and Polygnotus.</p>

<p>To discuss the bearings of the linguistic and solar theories of
mythology may be reserved for another part of this essay. It is
enough, at this point, to bear in mind that there was nothing in
the consciousness of the prehistoric Greeks which did not take
the form of myth. Consequently their mythology, instead of
being a compact system of polytheism, is really a whole mass
of thought, belonging to a particular period of human history,
when it was impossible to think except by pictures, or to record
impressions of the world except in stories. That all these tales
are religious or semi-religious&mdash;concerned, that is to say, with
deities&mdash;must be explained by the tendency of mankind at an
early period of culture to conceive the powers of nature as persons,
and to dignify them with superhuman attributes. To the
apprehension of infantine humanity everything is a god. Viewed
even as a Pantheon, reduced to rule and order by subsequent
reflection, Greek mythology is, therefore, a mass of the most heterogeneous
materials. Side by side with some of the sublimest
and most beautiful conceptions which the mind has ever pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>duced,
we find in it much that is absurd and trivial and revolting.
Different ages and conditions of thought have left their products
embedded in its strange conglomerate. While it contains fragments
of fossilized stories, the meaning of which has either been
misunderstood or can only be explained by reference to barbaric
customs, it also contains, emergent from the rest and towering
above the rubbish, the serene forms of the Olympians. Those
furnish the vital and important elements of Greek mythology.
To perfect them was the work of poets and sculptors in the
brief, bright blooming time of Hellas. Yet, when we pay these
deities homage in the temple of the human spirit, let us not forget
that they first received form in the mythop&#339;ic age&mdash;the age
of "the disease of language," as Max M&uuml;ller whimsically states it.</p>

<p>In order to comprehend a problem so complex as that which
is offered by mythology, we must not be satisfied with approaching
it from one point of view, but must sift opinion, submit our
theory to the crucible in more than one experiment, and, after all
our labor, be content to find that much remains still unexplained.
Therefore, it will not do to accept without further inquiry the
general description of the mythop&#339;ic faculty which has just been
advanced. After examining the various methods which may be
adopted for dealing with the myths, and welcoming the light
which can be thrown upon the subject from different quarters, it
will, perhaps, be possible to return to the original position with a
fuller understanding of the problem. If nothing else be gained
by this process, it is, at least, useful to be reminded that intricate
historical questions cannot be settled by one answer alone; that
a variety of agencies must be admitted; and that the domination
of a favorite hypothesis is prejudicial to the end which serious
inquiry has in view.</p>

<p>Regarding the Greek myths in their totality as a thickly tufted
jungle of inexplicable stories, and presupposing the activity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
mythop&#339;ic faculty to be a play of irrational fancy, it is possible
for the political historian to state them as he finds them, and
then to pass on and to disregard them. This is, practically speaking,
what Grote has done, though the luminous and exhaustive
treatment of mythology in his sixteenth chapter proves his complete
mastery of the subject from the philosophic point of view.
Solely occupied with history, and especially interested in political
history, when he has once recognized "the uselessness of digging
for a supposed basis of truth" in legends which relate to "a past
which was never present," he is justified in leaving them alone.
The strong political bias which concentrates attention upon the
development of constitutions and the history of states, while it
throws the &aelig;sthetic activity of the race into the background, sufficiently
accounts for this negative relation to the myths. Its
value for our purpose consists in the recognition that mythology
must not be confounded with history.</p>

<p>Another method of dealing with mythology requires a passing
notice, and a brief dismissal. It has not unfrequently been suggested
at uncritical periods of culture, and by uncritical minds in
our own age, that the Greek myths are the degradation of primitive
truth revealed to mankind by God. As they are Christians
who advance this view, the essential dogmas of Christianity are
sought for in the Greek Pantheon. The three persons of the
Trinity, the personality of the devil, the Divine Redeemer, and so
forth, are read into the sagas of Kronos and Prometheus and
Ph&#339;bus. To bring arguments against a theory so visionary, and
so devoid of real historical imagination, would be superfluous.
Otherwise, it might be questioned how a primitive revelation,
after undergoing such complete disintegration and debasement,
blossomed forth again into the &aelig;sthetical beauty which no one
can deny to be the special property of the Greek race. According
to the terms of the hypothesis, a primal truth was first de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>graded,
so as to lose its spiritual character; and then, from this
corruption of decay, arose a polytheism eminently artistic, which
produced works of beauty in their kind unsurpassable, but in their
essence diverse from the starting-point of revelation. Moreover,
the very dogmas which these visionaries detect in Greek mythology
had an historical development posterior to the formation of
the Greek Olympus. It was, for instance, the Greek genius in its
old age which gave the substantiality of thought to the doctrine
of the Trinity. The only good to be got from the consideration
of this vain method is the conviction that a problem like that of
Greek mythology must be studied in itself and for itself. Whatever
its antecedents may have been, its outgrowth in poetry, philosophy,
and sculpture&mdash;in other words, its realized or permanent
manifestation&mdash;is not Christian, and has nothing but general human
elements in common with Christianity.</p>

<p>A third hypothesis for the explanation of Greek myths, which
used to find much favor with the learned, may be stated thus.
Myths were originally invented by priests and sages, in order to
convey to the popular mind weighty truths and doctrines which
could not be communicated in abstract terms to weak intelligences.
Thus, each myth was a dark speech uttered in parables. The first
fatal objection to this theory is that it does not fulfil its own conditions.
To extract a body of doctrine from the vast majority of
the myths is not possible. Moreover, it is an inversion of the
natural order to assume that priests and sages in a very early age
of culture should have been able to arrive at profound truth, and
clever enough to clothe it in parable, and yet that, as the nation
grew in mental power, the truths should have been forgotten, and
the symbols which expressed them have been taken as truth in
and for itself. Without, however, entering into a discussion of
this hypothesis in detail, it is enough to point out that it implies
the same incapacity for realizing the early conditions of society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
which is involved in Locke's and Adam Smith's theory of the
Origin of Language. It presupposes fully developed intelligence,
whereas we are concerned precisely with the first and germinal
commencement of intelligence. At the same time there is a certain
foundation for the symbolic theory. Just in the same way
as all language is unconsciously metaphorical, so all myths are
parabolical, inasmuch as they involve the operation of thought
seeking to express itself externally. The mistake lies in maintaining
that the parabolic form was deliberately used in the prehistoric
period. Its deliberate employment must rather be confined
to the age of self-conscious thinking. Thus the myths by
which Plato illustrated his philosophy, the Empedoclean parable
of Love and Hate, the Choice of Herakles invented by the sophist
Prodicus, are purposely symbolical. It is also worth noticing that,
among genuine myths, those which seem to justify this hypothesis
are of comparatively late origin, or are immediately concerned
with psychological questions&mdash;such, for example, as the myths of
Cupid and Psyche and of Pandora and Epimetheus.</p>

<p>A fourth way of dealing with mythology is to rationalize it, by
assuming that all the marvellous stories told about the gods and
heroes had historical foundation in the past. Myths, according to
this method, become the reminiscences of actual facts, the biographies
of persons, which in course of time have lost their positive
truth. In order to recover and reconstitute that truth, it is necessary
to reduce them to prose. Thus Hecat&aelig;us, who was one of
the earliest among the Greeks to attempt this interpretation, declared
that Geryon was a king of Epirus, and that Cerberus was a
serpent haunting the caverns of Cape T&aelig;narus. Herodotus, in
like manner, explained the sacred black dove of Dodona by saying
that she was a woman, who came from Egyptian Thebes, and introduced
a peculiar cult of Zeus into Hellas. After the same
fashion, Python, slain by Ph&#339;bus, was supposed to have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
troublesome freebooter. &AElig;olus was changed into a weatherwise
seaman, the Centaurs into horsemen, Atlas into an astronomer,
Herakles into a strong-limbed knight-errant. It was when the old
feeling for the myths had died out among the learned, when physical
hypotheses were adopted for the explanation of the heavens
and the earth instead of the religious belief in nature-deities, and
when prose had usurped on poetry, that this theory was worked
into a system. Euhemerus, the contemporary of the Macedonian
Cassander, wrote a kind of novel in which he made out that all
the gods and heroes had once been men. Ennius translated this
work into Latin, and the rationalizing method was called Euhemerism.
The hold which it has retained upon the minds of succeeding
ages is sufficient to show that it readily approves itself to
the understanding. It seems to make everything quite smooth
and easy. When, for instance, we read the revolting legend of
Pasipha&euml; we like to fancy that after all she only fell in love with
a captain called Taurus, and that D&aelig;dalus was an artful go-between.
Unfortunately, however, there is no guide more delusive
than Euhemerism. It destroys the true value of mythology, considered
as the expression of primitive thought and fancy, reducing
it to a mere decayed and weed-grown ruin of prosaic fact.
Plato was right when he refused to rationalize the myths, and
when, by his own use of myths, he showed their proper nature as
the vehicle for thoughts as yet incapable of more exact expression.
At the same time it would be unphilosophical to deny that
real persons and actual events have supplied in some cases the
subject-matter of mythology. The wanderings of Odysseus, the
Trojan War, the voyage of the Argonauts, the kingdom of Minos,
the achievements of Herakles, have, all of them, the appearance of
dimly preserved or poetized history. Yet to seek to reconstruct
history from them, "to dig for a supposed basis of truth" in
them, is idle. The real thing to bear in mind is that great men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and stirring events must have been remembered even in the mythop&#339;ic
age, and that to eliminate them from the national consciousness
would have been impossible. A nucleus of fact may,
therefore, have formed the basis of certain myths, just as a wire
immersed in a solution of salts will cause the fluid to condense in
crystals round it. But, as in the case just used by way of illustration,
we do not see the wire, but the crystals, after the process
has been finished, so in mythology it is not the fact but the fancy
which attracts our attention and calls for our consideration. This
illustration might be extended so as to apply to any substratum,
linguistic, solar, symbolical, or other, that may be supposed to
underlie the fancy-fabric of mythology. The truth to be looked
for in myths is psychological, not historical, &aelig;sthetic rather than
positive.</p>

<p>In order to make the relation of actuality to imagination in the
mythop&#339;ic process still more intelligible, another illustration can
be drawn from nature. Pearls are said to be the result of a secretion
effused from the pearl-oyster round a piece of grit or thorn
inserted between its flesh and the shell in which it lives. To the
production of the pearl this extraneous object and the irritation
which it causes are both necessary; yet the pearl is something in
itself quite independent of the stimulating substance. Just so
the myth, which corresponds to the pearl, is a secretion of the
national imagination which has been roused into activity by something
accidental and exterior.</p>

<p>It is possible to take a fifth line and to refer mythology to fetichism.
Strictly speaking, fetichism can never explain the problem
of the mythop&#339;ic faculty, except in so far as we may assume
it to have formed a necessary stage of human development anterior
to polytheism. Greek mythology, together with Greek nature-worship,
would, according to this fifth method of interpretation,
have to be regarded as a refinement on the savage dread of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
fetiches. Beginning with a servile prostration before the powers
of nature, this attitude of simple awe would have been gradually
elevated to the height which it attained in Homer and Hesiod.
In the progressive amelioration of the race myths would thus have
occupied a middle place between the fetich and the free divinities
of art. Putting aside all the difficulties which involve the question
whether fetichism is rightly regarded as the first attitude of
man towards nature, it is clear that the fetichistic hypothesis cannot
cover the whole field of our inquiry. What it does do is to
offer an explanation of the origin of nature-worship, and to account
for the fact that external objects are regarded as living,
sentient beings in the myths. Long before the philosophers of
Ionia conjectured that the stars are fiery vapors, people fancied
they were gods. It has been well observed that the Greeks never
speak of a god <i>of the</i> sun, or a goddess <i>of the</i> moon. They worshipped
the sun as a god in Helios, the moon as a goddess in Selene.
This direct reference of the mind to natural things as objects
of adoration may, possibly, be a purified form of fetichism.
But, taken by itself alone, fetichism is not adequate to account
for the many-sided, many-featured product of the mythical imagination,
which continued active long after the age of savagery.
Nor, indeed, have the historians, who attribute great importance
to this stage of religious feeling, claimed for it so much.</p>

<p>According to yet a sixth view the myths are to be considered
as nothing more or less than poems. This theory is not, at first
sight, very different from that which is involved in the first account
given of the mythop&#339;ic faculty. It is clear that the stories
of Galatea, of Pan and Pitys, of Hesperus and Hymen&aelig;us, and,
in a deeper sense, perhaps, of Prometheus and Pandora, are pure
poems. That is to say, the power which produced them was
analogous to the power which we observe in poetic creation at
the present day, and which has continued the mythop&#339;ic age into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the nineteenth century. Yet we should lose a great deal in exactitude
and fulness of conception if we identified mythology with
poetry. Poetry is conscious of its aim; it demands a fixed form;
it knows itself to be an art, and, as an art, to be different from religion
and distinguished from history. Now, mythology in its origin
was antecedent to all such distinctions, and to all the conscious
adaptations of means to ends. Behind the oldest poetry which we
possess there looms a background of mythology, substantially existing,
already expressed in language, nebulous, potential, containing
in itself the germs of all the several productions of the human
intellect. The whole intellect is there in embryo; and behind
mythology nothing is discoverable but thought and language in
the same sphere. Therefore we lose rather than gain by a too
strict adherence to what may be termed the poetical hypothesis,
although the analogy of poetry, and of poetry alone, places us at
the right point of view for comprehending the exercise of the
myth-making faculty.</p>

<p>Before completing the circle of inquiry by a return with fuller
knowledge to the point from which we started, it is necessary to
discuss a seventh way of dealing with the problem, which professes
to be alone the truly scientific method. It may be called the
linguistic theory, since it rests upon analysis of language, and
maintains that mythology is not so much an independent product
of the human mind, expressed in words, as a morbid phase of
language, considered as a thing apart. Max M&uuml;ller, who has given
currency to this view in England, states expressly that "Mythology,
which was the bane of the ancient world, is in truth a disease
of language. A myth means a word, but a word which, from being
a name or an attribute, has been allowed to assume a more substantial
existence;" and again, under mythology "I include every
case in which language assumes an independent power and reacts
on the mind, instead of being, as it was intended to be, the mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
realization and outward embodiment of the mind." The first
thing which strikes a student accustomed to regard mythology as
a necessary and important phase in the evolution of thought, when
he reads these definitions, is the assumption that &#956;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#962; is synonymous
with what we mean by word, instead of including the wider
content of a story told in words. He is thus led to suspect a
theory which contrives to make the problem of mythology pass
for a branch of philology. Nor can he comprehend in what
sense mythology may be called "a disease of language" rather
than a disease of the mind which uses language. Does Max
M&uuml;ller mean that language suffered, or that the thinking subject
suffered through the action of the bane? He probably means the
former; but, if so, language must be supposed to live a life apart
from thought, triumphing over the freedom of the human mind,
and imposing its figments on the intellect. Such a belief might
seem due partly to a too exclusive study of language in itself, in
the course of which the philologer comes to regard it as disconnected
from thought, and partly to the neglect of the fact that it
is the same human subject which produces language and myths,
that language and thought in their origin are inseparable, but that
when language has once been started, it has to serve the various
purposes of thought, and lend itself to myth and poem, philosophical
analysis and religious dogma. Another point to criticise is
the inevitable corollary that the soul of a great nation, like the
Greeks, for instance, in the course of its advance to the maturity
of art and freedom, passes through a period of derangement and
disease, by which its civilization is vitiated, its vitality poisoned
at the root, and all its subsequent achievements tainted; and that
this spiritual phthisis can be traced to a sickly state of language
at a very remote historical period when as yet the nation was
scarcely constituted. Seriously to entertain this view is tantamount
to maintaining that corruption and disease may be the di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>rect
efficient causes of the highest art on which humanity can
pride itself, since it is indubitable that the poems of Homer and
the sculptures of Pheidias are the direct outgrowth of that "bane
of the ancient world" which, to quote another pithy saying of
Max M&uuml;ller, converted <i>nomina</i> into <i>numina</i>. It is hardly necessary
to point out the curious want of faith in the Welt-Geist (or
God) which this implies; the unimaginative habit of mind we
should encourage if we failed to discern the excellence of a civilization
that owed its specific character to mythology; the unphilosophical
conclusions to which we might be brought if we denied
that the intelligence is free while following the fixed laws of its
evolution, and that the essential feature in this evolution is the
advance from rudimentary to more developed thought. Language,
however potent in reaction upon thought, is after all the
vehicle and instrument of thought, and not its master. This
leads to yet a further criticism: granting that language was "intended
to be the mere realization and outward embodiment of the
mind"&mdash;though this is a wide begging of the most difficult of
all questions&mdash;it does not follow that in mythology language is
not pursuing its appointed function. If the mythological phase
of thought is less apparent among the Semitic than among the
Aryan nations, are we to say that this is so because the Semitic
languages escaped the whooping-cough of mythology, or not far
rather because the mind of the Aryan races had a greater aptitude
for mythology, a greater aptitude for art? In the fifth place, the
definition of mythology is too wide for the special purpose of the
problem. Bacon long ago pointed out that one of the chief
sources of error arises from our tendency to mistake words for
realities. This imperfect adjustment of language to the purposes
of thought is not peculiar to the mythop&#339;ic age. When we use
such phrases as "vital force," we are designating the results of
observation and experience by a word which ought not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
regarded as more than a sign. Yet, because "vital force" has
sometimes been recognized as something positive and substantially
existent, we cannot on that account call it a myth without
impoverishing the resources of language, and making one word do
the work of two. The truth, therefore, is, that in the mythop&#339;ic
as in every other age, words have done violence to thought; nor
need it be contested that the <i>idola fori</i> were more potent in the
infancy than in the maturity of intelligence. While concerned
with this branch of our critique, it is curious to observe the satisfaction
with which the advocates of the linguistic theory use it
as the means of rehabilitating the moral character of the ancient
Greeks, by trying to make out that the tales of &#338;dipus, Pelops,
and Kronos owe their repulsive elements to verbal mistakes. To
the student it is undoubtedly a relief to fancy that the incest of
Jocasta was originally no more than a figurative way of speaking
about the alternations of day and night. He derives, indeed, the
same sort of contentment by this method as the rationalist who
explains the legend of Pasipha&euml; upon Euhemeristic principles.
Yet it is surely a poor way of whitewashing the imagination of
the ancients to have recourse to a theory which sees in myths
nothing better than a mange or distemper breaking out in language,
and tormenting the human mind for a season. Nor can
the theory be stretched so far as to exonerate the nation from its
share of interest in these stories. The people who made the supposed
linguistic mistakes delighted in the grotesque and fantastic
legends which were produced. Even if words deluded them, their
wills were free and their brains at work while under the pernicious
influence. The real way of exculpating the conscience of
the Greeks, indicated both by philosophy and common-sense, is
to point out that in the age of reflection the tragic poets moralized
these very myths, and made them the subject-matter of the
gravest art, while the sages instituted a polemic against the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>fusion
of fabulous mythology with the pure notion of Godhead
obtained by reflection.</p>

<p>The theory of development which seems to underlie the linguistic
doctrine is, that thought in its earliest stage is positive
and clear and adequate. The first savage who thinks sees the
sun, for example, and calls it the sun; but in talking about the
sun he begins to use figurative language, and so converts his simple
propositions into myths. At this point, argues the philologer,
he goes wrong and becomes the victim of delusions. The fallacy
in this view appears to lie in attributing to the simple and sensuous
apprehension of the savage the same sort of simplicity as that
which we have gained by a process of abstraction, and consequently
inferring that the importation of fancy into the thinking process
implies a species of degeneracy. The truth seems rather to
be quite the contrary. If we grant, for the sake of argument,
that the first thoughts are in a certain sense simple, they have
nothing in common with the generalizations of the understanding.
Except in relation to immediate perceptions, their generality
is empty until it has been filled up with the varied matter
of the senses and the imagination. Mythology and poetry are,
therefore, an advance upon the primitive prose of simple apprehension.
What was a mere round ball becomes a d&aelig;dal world;
and it is not till the full cycle of the myth-creating fancy has
been exhausted that the understanding can return upon a higher
level by abstraction to intellectual simplicity. The same is true
about theology. The first dim sense of the divine in nature as a
unity may possibly have been prior to the many deities of polytheism;
men may have looked upon the open sky and called that
god. Yet it was not a retrogression, but an advance from that
first perception to the mythological fulness and variety which
gave concreteness to the notion of the deity. In this way the
whole content of human nature&mdash;feeling, sense, activity, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
forth&mdash;was imported into the original and hollow notion; or, to
state the process with greater accuracy, the germ of thought, by
unfolding its potentiality, showed that what had seemed a barren
unit was a complicated organism with a multiplicity of parts. It
remained for a further stage of thought, by reflection and abstraction,
to return at a higher level to the conception of intellectual
unity. What we have to guard against is the temptation to attribute
our own abstractedness, the definiteness of positivism, the
purity of monotheism, to the first stage of thought. Ours is the
triumph of the understanding in its vigor over bewildering fulness;
theirs was the poverty and nakedness of a first awakening
of intelligence. The same critique might be applied to the theory
that language starts with universals. Here, again, all turns
upon the question, What sort of universals? Unless we are cautious,
we run the risk of ending in a view almost identical with
the theory of primitive revelation, by following which to its conclusions
we are forced to regard the history of the human race,
not as a process of development, but as a series of disastrous errors
and of gradual decline.</p>

<p>What remains the solid outcome of the linguistic theory is that
in the mythop&#339;ic age, when there was no criticism and no reflection
possible, the <i>idola fori</i> were far more powerful than now, and
consequently many legends were invented to account for words of
which the true meaning had been forgotten. Accordingly philology
is one of the keys by which the door of mythology may be
unlocked. At the same time, considering the complex relations
of thought to language, especially in their commencement, it is
wrong to concentrate attention upon language. In like manner,
it will be admitted that the genders of the nouns contributed their
quota to the personification of female and male deities; but it
would be wrong to argue that the <i>numina</i> were divided into male
and female because the <i>nomina</i> were so distinguished. In order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to appreciate the personifying instinct, we must go back in imagination
to a point beyond the divergence of thought and language;
and we shall find that if priority can be assigned to either,
it will be to thought, as that by which alone the human subject
can be said to be. Language has sex because sex is a property of
the talking being. The deities are male and female, not because
their names have genders, but because the thinking being, for
whom sex is all-important, thinks its own conditions into the
world outside it.</p>

<p>The linguistic theory for the interpretation of mythology is
based upon comparative philology, which has proved beyond all
contest that the Aryan races had not only their grammar, but a
certain number of their myths in common before the separation
of the Hindoo, Hellenic, and Teutonic stocks. The Vedic literature
exhibits the mythological material in rudiment, and its style
approximates to that of poetry. Hence it has been assumed that
the disease of language was less virulent in the oldest Aryan writings
than it afterwards became in Hesiod and Homer&mdash;the <i>nomina</i>
had not as yet been so utterly deformed and corrupted into
<i>numina</i>. The inefficiency of arguments like this is that they have
no value except in relation to a previously adopted view. To the
opponent of the linguistic as the only scientific method for the explanation
of myths, it is left to answer: What you regard as corruption
of language I regard as development of thought. What
interests me in Greek mythology is precisely this: that the Aryan
poems have passed into complicated stories illustrative of pure
Hellenic modes of thought and feeling, which in their turn will
give occasion for epics, dramas, statues, and philosophies. In the
same way, the amount of similarity which comparative mythology
has demonstrated in the myths of all the members of the Aryan
family is, from the Greek historian's point of view, far less
important than their differences. The similarity belongs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
stock as it existed in prehistoric times. The differences mark
the external conditions and internal qualities of the nations as
they played their part in the world's history. The "disease of
language" which severally afflicted the Hindoos, the Persians, the
Greeks, and the Scandinavians, turns out to be a faithful mirror
of their concrete life. Any one, by way of illustration, can work
out the problem of national psychology offered by the nature-worship
of the sun in Ormuzd, in Ph&#339;bus, and in Balder. The pale
and beautiful Balder, who must perish, and whose death involves
the world in wailing; the radiant and conquering Ph&#339;bus, the
healing deity, the purifier, the voice of prophecy and poetry and
music; Ormuzd, the antagonist of darkness and of evil, the object
of desire and adoration to the virtuous and pure&mdash;these sun-gods
answer to the races, as their geographical conditions and their
spirit made them. Nor is this all. The mythology of each nation
has a physiognomy and character of its own&mdash;that of the
Greeks being clearness and articulation in opposition to the formlessness
and misty vagueness of the Hindoos. To mistake a
Greek tale of deity or hero for a Hindoo tale of deity or hero is
impossible. While the student of prehistorical antiquities will,
therefore, direct attention to the likeness revealed by comparative

and religion.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p>One of the most salient points of similarity between the several
families of Aryan myths concerns those which are called solar
legends. In all of these we read of children fated to slay their
fathers, of strong giants condemned to obey the rule of feeble
princes, of heroic young men forced to quit their first love for
another woman. The heroes of these stories are marked out in
their cradle by miraculous signs and wonders, or are suckled by
wild beasts in the absence of their parents; in their youth they
slay serpents sent to destroy them; in their manhood they shine
forth as conquerors. Their death is not unfrequently caused by
slight and unforeseen, though fated, occurrences&mdash;by a weapon
that strikes the only vulnerable part of their body, in the case of
Achilles and Siegfried; by a twig of mistletoe, in the case of
Balder; by a thorn, in the case of Isfendiyar; by an envenomed
mantle, in the case of Herakles. One great mythus fascinated
the imagination of Norsemen and Hindoos, Greek and Persian,
German and Roman; interwove itself with their history; gave a
form to their poetry; and assumed a prominent place in their religion.
So far, it may be said that comparative philology has established
something solid, which is at the same time of vast importance
for the student of prehistorical antiquity. It is also not
improbable that these legends referred originally to the vicissitudes
of the sun in his yearly and daily journeys through the
heavens. Thus much may be conceded to the solar theorists, remembering
always that this primitive astronomical significance, if
it existed, was forgotten by the races for whom the myths became
the material of poetry and religion. But, unfortunately, the discovery
has been strained beyond its proper limits by students who
combine a solar theory with the linguistic in their interpretation
of mythology. In their hands all the myths are made to refer to
the sun and the moon, to dawn and evening. "The difficulty,"
says Max M&uuml;ller, "which I myself have most keenly felt is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
monotonous character of the dawn and sun legends. Is everything
the dawn? is everything the sun? This question I had
asked myself many times before it was addressed me by others."
How consistently Professor Max M&uuml;ller found himself obliged to
answer this question in the affirmative is known to every student
of his works, not to mention those of Mr. Cox. The hand-books
of mythology which are now in vogue in England expound this
solar theory so persistently that it is probable a race is growing
up who fancy that the early Greeks talked with most "damnable
iteration" of nothing but the weather, and that their conversation
on that fruitful topic fell sick of some disease, breeding the tales
of Thebes and Achilles and Pelops's line, as a child breeds measles.
It is therefore necessary to subject it to criticism.</p>

<p>The first point for notice is that mythology lends itself almost
as well to meteorological as to solar theories. Kuhn and Schwartz,
as Professor M&uuml;ller himself informs us, arrived at the conclusion
that "originally the sun was conceived implicitly as a mere accident
in the heavenly scenery." Instead, therefore, of finding the
sun and the dawn in all the myths, they are always stumbling
upon clouds and winds and thunder. This differing of the doctors
is, after all, no great matter. Yet it warns us to be careful
in adopting so exclusively, as is the present fashion, either the solar
or the meteorological hypothesis. A second consideration
which inclines to caution is the facility of adapting the solar theory
to every story, whether fabulous or historical. In this sense
the famous tract which proved that Napoleon the Great only existed
in the mythical imagination may be taken as a <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> of the method. A third ground for suspension of
judgment lies in the very elaborate manipulation which the etymologies
of such words as Eros, Erinnys, and the Charites have
undergone before they yielded up their solar content. But the
multiplication of general objections is not to the present purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
It is enough to bear in mind that, however important the sun was
to the ancient Aryans, he could not have been everything: he
was, after all, but one among many objects of interest; and what
requires to be still more remembered, is that the Greeks themselves
in dealing with the tales of Achilles, or of Kephalos and
Prokris, did not know that they were handling solar stories. It
is, therefore, misleading to base hand-books which serve as introductions
to Greek literature and art upon speculation about the
solar groundwork of the myths. In the works of Homer and
Hesiod, of &AElig;schylus and Sophocles, the myths were animated
with spiritual, intellectual, and moral life. To draw the lessons
from them which those poets drew, to demonstrate the grandeur
of the imagination which could deal with those primeval tragic
tales, should be the object of the educator; not to fill his pages
with extremely doubtful matter about sun and dawn <i>ad infinitum</i>.
The true relation of the solar theory to a Greek myth may be
illustrated by the tale of Herakles, whom the Greeks themselves
may perhaps have recognized as a solar deity, since Herodotus
identified him with a Ph&#339;nician god.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> We are therefore justified
in dealing with this hero as a personification of the sun.
Herakles is the child of Zeus. He strangles in his cradle the serpents
of the night. He loves Iole, or the violet-colored clouds of
dawn. He performs twelve labors, corresponding to the twelve
months of the solar year. He dies of a poisoned robe amid
flames that may be taken for the blood-red sunset clouds. The
maiden Iole, now evening and not morning, visits him again in
death; and he ascends from his funeral pyre of empurpled mountain
peaks to heaven. Let all this be granted. So far the solar
theory carries us. But is this all? In other words, is this, which
the current hand-books tell us about Herakles, the pith of the
matter as it appeared to the Greeks? When we turn to the <i>Philosophy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>of History</i> of Hegel, who worked by another than the
solar method, and was more anxious to discover thoughts than
etymologies, we read: "Hercules is among the Hellenes that spiritual
humanity which, by native energy, attains Olympus through
the twelve far-famed labors; but the foreign idea that lies at the
basis is the sun completing its revolution through the twelve
signs of the Zodiac." Here we touch the truth. The solar
foundation of the mythus is wholly valueless and unimportant&mdash;in
other words, is alien to its essence, when compared with the
moral import it acquired among the Greeks. It is the conception
of life-long service to duty, of strength combined with patience,
of glory followed at the cost of ease, of godhead achieved
by manhood through arduous endeavor&mdash;it is this that is really
vital in the myth of Herakles. By right of this the legend entered
the sphere of religion and of art. In this spirit the sophist
enlarged upon it, when he told how Herakles in his youth chose
virtue with toil rather than pleasure, incorporating thus the high
morality of Hesiod with the mythical element. If myths like
these are in any sense diseased words about the sun, we must go
further and call them immortalized words, words that have attained
eternal significance by dying of the disease that afflicted them.
The same remarks apply to all the solar and lunar stories&mdash;to
Achilles, Endymion, Kephalos, and all the rest. As solar myths
these tales had died to the Greeks. As poems, highly capable of
artistic treatment, in sculpture, or in verse, pregnant with humanity,
fit to form the subject of dramatic presentation or ethical debate,
they retained incalculable value. The soul of the nation
was in them. And that is their value for us.</p>

<p>To deny the important part which the sun, like the earth or
the sea, played in early mythology would be absurd. To dispute
the illumination which comparative philology has thrown not
only upon the problem of the myths, but also upon the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
unity of races until recently divided in our thought, would be still
more ridiculous. The point at issue is simply this, that in Greek
mythology there is far more than linguistic and solar theories can
explain, and that <i>more</i> is precisely the Greek genius. The philologer
from his point of view is justified in directing attention
to the verbal husk of myths; but the student of art and literature
must keep steadily in view the kernel of thought and feeling
which the myths contain. It is only by so doing that the
poetry and art which sprang from them can be intelligently studied.
Thus the modern text-books of mythology are misleading,
in so far as they draw the learner's mind away from subjects of
historical importance to bare arch&aelig;ology.</p>

<p>As the result of analysis, the following propositions may be
advanced. In the earliest ages the races to whom we owe languages
and literature and art possessed a faculty which may be
called the mythop&#339;ic, now almost wholly extinct, or rather superseded
by the exercise of other faculties which it contained in embryo.
The operation of this faculty was analogous to that of the
poetic; that is to say, it was guided by the imagination more
than by the dry light of the understanding, and its creative energy
varied in proportion to the imaginative vigor of the race which
exercised it. The distinction here introduced is all-important;
for only thus can we explain the very different nature of the
Greek and Roman religions. The tendency to personification
which distinguishes mythology was due to the instinct of uncivilized
humanity to impute to external objects a consciousness similar
to that by which men are governed&mdash;in other words, to regard
them as living agents with wills and passions like our own. If
fetichism be the rudimentary phase of this instinct, polytheism
indicates an advance by which the mind has passed from the
mere recognition of spiritual power in nature to the investment
of that power with personal and corporeal qualities. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
just as the imagination varies in degree and force in different
races, so will this power of carrying the personifying instinct onward
into art be found to vary. The Romans stopped short at
allegories; in other words, they did not carry their personification
beyond the first stage. The Greeks created divine personalities.
Many myths contain moral and philosophical ideas conveyed in
parables, and some of them have indubitable reference to real
events and persons. But in no case of a primitive and genuine
mythus are we to expect deliberate fiction or conscious symbolism,
or, again, to seek for a discoverable substratum of solid fact.
Entering the sphere of mythology, facts become etherealized into
fancies, the actual value of which lies in the expression of the national
mind, so that mythical and spiritual are in this respect
synonymous. To use a metaphor, a myth is a Brocken-spectre
of the thought which produced it, and owes the features by which
we can distinguish it to the specific character of the people among
whom it sprang into existence. The analysis of language shows
that the whole Aryan family held a great number of their myths
in common, that many legends are stories told to account for
words and phrases which had lost their original significance, and
that in these stories the alternations of night and day and the procession
of the seasons played a very important part. Philology
can, however, furnish no more than the prolegomena to mythology.
After hearing its report, the student of Greek art and literature
must take the Greek myths at a Greek valuation&mdash;must consider
what they were for the Athenians, for example, and not
what they had once been. Finally, it may be remembered that
to hope for a complete elucidation of a problem so far removed
from observation and experiment would be vain. The conditions
of the mythop&#339;ic age cannot be reconstituted; and were they to
reappear through the destruction of civilizations, the reflective understanding
would not be present to examine and record them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulty which besets the problem of mythology, owing to
the remote antiquity of the myth-making age, is to some extent
removed by observing the operation of the mythop&#339;ic faculty in
the historic period. Given social circumstances similar, if even
only in a limited degree, to those of the prehistoric age; given a
defect of the critical and reflective faculty, an absence of fixed
records, and a susceptible condition of the popular imagination,
myths have always sprung up. While it is not, therefore, possible
to find exact analogies to the conditions under which the
Greek mythology originated, something may be gained by directing
attention to medi&aelig;val romance. The legends which in Italy
converted Virgil into a magician, the epic cycles of Charles the
Great and Arthur, the Lives of the Saints, the fable of Tannh&auml;user
and the Venusberg, the Spanish tale of Don Juan, and the
German tale of Faust are essentially mythical. What is instructive
about medi&aelig;val romance for the student of mythology in
general is that here the mythop&#339;ic imagination has been either
dealing with dim recollections of past history, or else has been
constructing for itself a story to express a doctrine. After excluding
the hypothesis of conscious working to a prefixed end, we,
therefore, find in these legends an illustration of the sense in which
the symbolical and rationalistic theories can be said to be justified.
In the case of Virgil, the poetry of Rome's greatest singer
never ceased to be studied during the darkest years of the dark
ages, and his name was familiar even to people who could not
read his verse. He was known to have been a pagan, and at the
same time possessed with what then seemed like superhuman
knowledge. It followed that he must have been a wizard, and
have gained his power and wisdom by compelling fiends. Having
formed this notion of Virgil, the popular fancy ascribed to
him all the vast works of architecture and engineering which remained
at Rome and Naples, inventing the most curious stories to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
explain why he had made them. When we turn to the Carlovingian
cycle, we discover that the great name of the Frankish emperor,
the memory of his wars, and the fame of his generals have
survived and been connected with the crusading enthusiasm which
pervaded Europe at a later period. Border-warfare between
France and Spain plays a prominent part in this epic, and gradually
the figure of Roland usurps upon the more historically important
personages. To "dig for a supposed basis of truth" in the
Carlovingian cycle would be vain; yet the view is forced upon us
that without some historical basis the cycle would not have sprung
into existence, or have formed a framework for the thought and
feeling of one period of the Middle Ages. The achievements of
Arthur must be regarded as still more wholly mythological. The
more we inquire into his personality, the less we find of real historical
subsistence. A Celtic hero, how created it is impossible to
say, becomes the central figure of the most refined romance which
occupied the attention of German, French, and British poets in
the Middle Ages. Round the fictitious incidents of his biography
gathers all that chivalry, with its high sense of humanity and its
profound religious mysticism, conceived of purest and most noble;
while, at the same time, certain dark and disagreeable details,
especially the incestuous union from which Mordred sprang,
remind us of the savage and unmoralized origin of the fable. We
therefore find in the Arthurian cycle something very much analogous
to the Tale of Troy. The dim memory of a national
struggle, an astronomical myth, perchance, and many incidents of
merely local interest have been blended together and filled with the
very spirit of the ages and the races that delighted in the story as
a story. This spiritual content gives its value to the epic. Medi&aelig;val
hagiography furnishes abundant examples of the way in
which facts transform themselves into fables and mythological
material is moulded into shape around some well-remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
name, the religious consciousness externalizing itself in acts which
it attributes to its heroes. When we read the <i>Fioretti di San
Francesco</i>, we are well aware that the saint lived&mdash;his life is one
of the chief realities of the thirteenth century; but we perceive
that the signs and wonders wrought by him proceed from the
imagination of disciples ascribing to St. Francis what belongs
partly to the ideal of his own character and partly to that of monastic
sanctity in general. In the fable of Tannh&auml;user we meet
with another kind of reminiscence. There is less of fact and
more of pure invention. The pagan past, existent as a sort of
d&aelig;monic survival, is localized at H&ouml;rsel. The interest, however,
consists here wholly in the parabolic meaning&mdash;whether Tannh&auml;user
ever existed does not signify. His legend is a poem of
the Christian knight ensnared by sin, aroused to a sense of guilt,
condemned by the supreme tribunal of the Church, and pardoned
by the grace of God. In like manner, the lust for knowledge, for
power, and for pleasure, withheld by God and nature, finds expression
in the Faust legend; while inordinate carnal appetite is
treated tragically in <i>Don Juan</i>. These three legends deserve to
be called myths rather than poems in the stricter sense of the
word, because they appear at many points and cannot be traced
up to three definite artistic sources, while it is clear from their
wide acceptance that they embodied thoughts which were held to
be of great importance. In them, therefore, we find illustrated
the theory which explains mythology by the analogy of poetry.
That the medi&aelig;val myths which have been mentioned never attained
the importance of Greek mythology is immediately accounted
for by the fact that they sprang up, as it were, under the
shadow of philosophy, religion, and history. They belonged to
the popular consciousness; and this popular consciousness had no
need or opportunity of converting its creatures into a body of beliefs,
because both science and orthodoxy existed. In the historic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
period mythology must always occupy this subordinate position;
and, perhaps, this fact might be reflected back as a further argument,
if such were needed, against the theories that the Greek
myths, while leading onward to the Greek Pantheon and Greek
art, originated as an undergrowth beneath the decaying fabric of
revealed truth or firmly apprehended philosophical ideas. At all
events, both the positive and negative circumstances which we
observe in them confirm the general view of mythology that has
been advanced.</p>

<p>The Homeric and Hesiodic poems were interposed between the
reflective consciousness of the Greeks in the historic age and the
mass of myths already existent in Hellas at the time of their composition,
and thus mythology passed into the more advanced stage
of art. It did not, however, cease on that account to retain some
portion of its original plasticity and fluidity. It is clear from
Pindar and the fragments of the minor lyric poets, from the
works of the dramatists, from Plato, and from other sources,
that what Herodotus reports about Homer and Hesiod having
fixed the genealogies of the gods cannot be taken too literally.
Non-Homeric and non-Hesiodic versions of the same tales were
current in various parts of Greece. The same deities in different
places received different attributes and different forms of worship;
and the same legends were localized in widely separated
spots. Each division of the Hellenic family selected its own
patron deities, expressing in their cult and ritual the specific
characteristics which distinguished Dorian, &AElig;olian, and Ionian
Hellas. At the same time certain headquarters of worship, like
the shrine of Delphi and the temple of Olympian Zeus, were
strictly Panhellenic. In this way it is clear that while Greek
mythology acquired the consistence of a natural religion, it retained
its free poetic character in a great measure. The nation
never regarded their myths as a body of fixed dogma, to alter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
which was impious. Great liberty, consequently, was secured for
artists; and it may be said with truth that the Greeks arrived
through sculpture at a consciousness of their gods. A new
statue was, in a certain sense, a new deity, although the whole
aim of the sculptor must, undoubtedly, have been to render visible
the thoughts contained in myths and purified by poetry, and
so to pass onward step-wise to a fuller and fuller realization of
the spiritual type. It is this unity, combined with difference, that
makes the study of Greek sculpture fascinating in itself, and fruitful
for the understanding of the Greek religion.</p>

<p>It lies beyond the scope of this chapter to consider how the
Greek intelligence was first employed upon the articulation of its
mythology, and next upon its criticism. The tradition of a Titanomachy,
or contest between nature-powers and deities of reason,
marks the first step in the former process. The cosmogonical
forces personified in the Titans gave place to the presiding
deities of political life and organized society, in whom the human
reason recognized itself as superior to mere nature. Olympus
was reserved for gods of intellectual order, and thus the Greeks
worshipped what was best and noblest in themselves. At the
same time the cosmogonical divinities were not excluded from
the Greek Pantheon, and so there grew up a kind of hierarchy
of greater and lesser deities. Oceanus, Poseidon, Proteus, the
Tritons and the Nereids, Amphitrite and Thetis, for example, are
all powers of the sea. They are the sea conceived under different
aspects, its divine personality being multitudinously divided
and delicately characterized in each case to accord with the
changes in the element. The same kind of articulation is observable
in the worship of deities under several attributes. Aphrodite
Ourania and Aphrodite Pandemos are one as well as two.
Eros and Himeros and Pothos are not so much three separate
loves, as love regarded from three different points of view. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the hierarchy is psychological, and represents an advance made
in reflection upon moral qualities; whereas in the former case
it was based on the observation of external nature. To this inquiry,
again, belongs the question of imported myths and foreign
cults. The worship of Corinthian Aphrodite, for example, was
originally Asiatic. Yet, on entering Greek thought, Mylitta ceased
to be Oriental and assumed Hellenic form and character. Sensuality
was recognized as pertaining to the goddess whose domain
included love and beauty and the natural desires.</p>

<p>More than the vaguest outlines of such subjects of interest cannot
be indicated here. It is enough to have pointed out that as
Greek mythology was eminently imaginative, fertile in fancy and
prolific in dramatic incident, so it found its full development in
poetry and art. Only through art can it be rightly comprehended;
and the religion for which it supplied the groundwork was
itself a kind of art. It is just this artistic quality which distinguished
the Greeks from the Romans. As Mommsen well observes,
"there was no formation of legend in the strict sense
in Italy." The Italian gods were in their origin more matter-of-fact
than Greek gods. They contained from the first a prosaic
element which they never threw aside; nor did they give
occasion to the growth of fable with its varied fabric of human
action and passion. Thus the legal and political genius
of the Latin race worshipped its own qualities in these allegorical
beings.</p>

<p>The process hitherto described has been the passage of mythology
into religion and the expression of religion by art. When
the Greek intelligence became reflective in the first dawn of philosophy,
it recognized that the notion of divinity, &#964;&#8056; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, was
independent and in some sense separable from the persons of the
Pantheon in whom it inhered. This recognition led to a criticism
of the myths by the standard of ideal godhead. Just as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Olympic deities, as representative of pure intellect or spirit, had
superseded the bare nature-forces, so now the philosophers sought
to distil a refined conception of God from the myths in general.
Their polemic was directed against Homer, in whom, like Herodotus,
they recognized the founder of the current mythological
theology. Both Pythagoras and Heraclitus are reported to have
said that Homer ought to be publicly thrust from the assembly
and scourged. Xenophanes plainly asserted that the Greek anthropomorphism
was no better than a worship of humanity with
all its vices, illustrating his critique by adding that just in the
same way might lions adore lions and horses horses. His own
conception of the deity was monotheistic, to this extent, at least,
that he abstracted from the universe a notion of divine power
and wisdom, and ascribed to it the only reality. Plato, in the
<i>Republic</i>, unified these points of view, severely criticising Homer
for the immorality of his fictions, and attributing to his own
demiurgic deity those qualities of goodness, truth, and beauty
which are the highest ideals of the human spirit. In connection
with this polemic against poetical theology, we have to notice the
attempts of physical philosophers to explain the universe by natural
causes, and the great saying of Anaxagoras that reason rules
the world. Thus the speculative understanding, following various
lines of thought and adopting diverse theories, tended to react
upon mythology and to corrode the ancient fabric of Greek polytheism.
In the course of this disintegrating process a new and
higher religion was developed, which Plato expressed by saying
that we ought "to become like God, as far as this is possible;
and to become like him is to become holy and just and wise."
At the same time those who felt the force of the critique, but
could not place themselves at the new scientific point of view,
remained sceptical; and against this kind of scepticism, which
implied personal lawlessness, Aristophanes directed his satire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Whatever may have been the attitude of philosophers in their
schools, mythology meanwhile retained its hold upon the popular
mind. It was bound up with the political traditions, the gentile
customs, the ritual, and the arts of the whole race. To displace
it by a reasoned system of theology, enforced by nothing
stronger than the theories of the sages, was impossible. The extent
to which philosophy permanently affected the creed of thinking
and religious men in Greece by substituting theism for the
fabulous theology of the poets has been well expressed in Plutarch's
<i>Life of Pericles</i>. "So dispassionate a temper," he observes,
"a life so pure and unblemished in authority, might well
be called Olympian, in accordance with our conceptions of the
divine beings to whom, as the natural authors of all good and of
nothing evil, we ascribe the rule and government of the world&mdash;not
as the poets represent, who, while confounding us with their
ignorant fancies, are themselves confuted by their own poems
and fictions, and call the place, indeed, where they say the gods
make their abode, 'a secure and quiet seat, untroubled with winds
or clouds,' and 'equally through all time illumined with a soft
serenity and a pure light,' as though such were a home most agreeable
for a blessed and immortal nature; and yet, in the meanwhile,
affirm that the gods themselves are full of trouble and enmity
and anger, and other passions which no way become or belong
to even men that have any understanding." It is clear that
when the religious consciousness had reached this point of purified
clairvoyance the race was ready for a more spiritual theology,
which philosophers like Marcus Aurelius found in natural religion,
while the common folk accepted Christianity.</p>

<p>After flowing side by side for many centuries, the currents of
mythological belief and of philosophical speculation reunited at
Alexandria, where a final attempt was made to animate the Homeric
Pantheon with the spirit of metaphysical mysticism. Ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>mer
became a priest as well as poet, and the <i>Iliad</i> was made to
furnish allegories for an age grown old in intellectual subtlety.
This was the last period of mythology. While Hypatia was
lecturing on Homer, the Christians were converting the world.
To keep the gods of Greece alive was no longer possible. Regarded
from the beginning as persons with a body corresponding
to their spiritual substance, they had in them the certainty of
dissolution. Though removed ideally beyond the sphere of human
chance and change, they remained men and women with
passions like our own. Pure spirit had not been realized in
them; and blind fate had from the first been held to be supreme
above them. Unlike the incarnate God of Christianity, they had
not passed forth from the spiritual world to abide here for a
season and return to it again. Therefore they perished. During
the domination of medi&aelig;val Christianity the utmost they could
do was to haunt the memory like wraiths and phantoms, to linger
in neglected and unholy places like malignant powers of evil.
But when the force of ascetic Christianity declined, and the spirit
of humane culture re-awoke in Europe, these old gods reasserted
their ascendency&mdash;no longer as divinities indeed, but as poems
forming an essential element of the imagination. The painters
and sculptors of Italy gave once more in breathing marble and
fair color form to those immortal thoughts. The poets sang the
old songs of Hellas in new language to new measures. Even the
Churchmen invoked God from Roman pulpits as <i>Summus Jupiter</i>,
and dignified Madonna with the attributes of Artemis and
Pallas.</p>

<p>Such is the marvellous vitality of this mythology. Such is its
indissoluble connection with the art and culture which sprang
from it, of which it was the first essential phase, and to which
we owe so much. Long after it has died as religion, it lives on
as poetry, retaining its original quality, though the theology con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>tained
in it has been forever superseded or absorbed into more
spiritual creeds.</p>

exclusive attention to the origin of Greek mythology. I want to remind students
of Greek literature that, after all they may have learned from Sanscrit,
they are still upon the threshold of mythology as it was determined by the
genius of the Greek race. There is a danger of diverting the mind from
questions of thoughts to questions of words, and leading people to fancy that
etymological solutions are final.</p></div>

and will be touched upon below. Supposing it to be proved that the
Romans can produce one relic of an Aryan myth in Romulus, we find that
their most native deities&mdash;Saturnus, Ops, Bellona, Janus, Terminus, Concordia,
Fides, Bonus Eventus, and so forth&mdash;are abstractions which have nothing in
common with Greek or other Aryan legends. They are the characteristic
product of the Roman mind, and indicate its habit of thought. In like manner
it is only by a crasis amounting to confusion that Mercurius can be identified
with Hermes, or Hercules with Herakles.</p></div>

<p>It is the sign of a return to healthy criticism that scholars are
beginning to acknowledge that the <i>Iliad</i> may be one poem&mdash;that
is to say, no mere patchwork of ballads and minor epics put together
by some diaskeuast in the age of Pisistratus, but the work
of a single poet, who surveyed his creation as an artist, and was
satisfied with its unity. We are not bound to pronounce an
opinion as to whether this poet was named Homer, whether
Homer ever existed, and, if so, at what period of the world's history
he lived. We are not bound to put forward a complete
view concerning the college of Homerid&aelig;, from which the poet
must have arisen, if he did not found it. Nor, again, need we
deny that the <i>Iliad</i> itself presents unmistakable signs of having
been constructed in a great measure out of material already existing
in songs and romances dear to the Greek nation in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
youth, and familiar to the poet. The &aelig;sthetic critic finds no
difficulty in conceding, nay, is eager to claim, a long genealogy
through antecedent, now forgotten, poems for the <i>Iliad</i>. But
about this, of one thing, at any rate, he will be sure, after due
experience of the tests applied by Wolf and his followers, that
a great artist gave its present form to the <i>Iliad</i>, that he chose
from the whole Trojan tale a central subject for development,
and that all the episodes and collateral matter with which he enriched
his epic were arranged by him with a view to the effect
that he had calculated.</p>

<p>What, then, was this central subject, which gives the unity of
a true work of art to the <i>Iliad</i>? We answer, the person and the
character of Achilles. It is not fanciful to say, with the old
grammarians of Alexandria, that the first line of the poem sets
forth the whole of its action&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sing, goddess, the wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The wrath of Achilles, and the consequences of that wrath in
the misery of the Greeks, left alone to fight without their fated
hero; the death of Patroclus, caused by his sullen anger; the energy
of Achilles, reawakened by his remorse for his friend's death;
and the consequent slaughter of Hector, form the whole of the
simple structure of the <i>Iliad</i>. This seems clear enough when we
analyze the conduct of the poem.</p>

<p>The first book describes the quarrel of Achilles with Agamemnon
and his secession from the war. The next seven books and
a half, from the second to the middle of the ninth, are occupied
with the fortunes of the Greeks and Trojans in the field, the exploits
of Diomede and Ajax, and Hector's attack upon the camp.
In the middle of the ninth book Achilles reappears upon the scene.
Agamemnon sends Ulysses and Ph&#339;nix to entreat him to relax
his wrath and save the Greeks; but the hero remains obdurate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
He has resolved that his countrymen shall pay the uttermost
penalty for the offense of their king. The poet having foredetermined
that Achilles shall only consent to fight in order to revenge
Patroclus, is obliged to show the inefficacy of the strongest motives
from without; and this he has effected by the episode of
the embassy. The tenth book relates the night attack upon the
camp of the Trojan allies and the theft of the horses of Rhesus.
The next five books contain a further account of the warfare carried
on among the ships between the Achaians and their foes. It
is in the course of these events that Patroclus comes into prominence.
We find him attending on the wounded Eurypylus and
warning Achilles of the imminent peril of the fleet. At last, in
the sixteenth book, when Hector has carried fire to the ship of
Protesilaus, Achilles commands Patroclus to assume the armor
of Peleus and lead his Myrmidons to war. The same book describes
the repulse of Hector and the death of Patroclus, while
the seventeenth is taken up with the fight for the body of Achilles'
friend. But from the eighteenth onward the true hero assumes
his rank as protagonist, making us feel that what has gone
before has only been a preface to his action. His seclusion from
the war has not only enabled the poet to vary the interest by displaying
other characters, but has also proved the final intervention
of Achilles to be absolutely necessary for the success of the Greek
army. All the threads of interest are gathered together and converge
on him. Whatever we have learned concerning the situation
of the war, the characters of the chiefs, and the jealousies of
the gods, now serves to dignify his single person and to augment
the terror he inspires. With his mere shout he dislodges the
Trojans from the camp. The divine arms of Heph&aelig;stus are
fashioned for him, and forth he goes to drive the foe like mice
before him. Then he contends with Simoeis and Scamander, the
river-gods. Lastly, he slays Hector. What follows in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>twenty-third
and twenty-fourth books seems to be intended as a repose
from the vehement action and high-wrought passion of the preceding
five. Patroclus is buried, and his funeral games are celebrated.
Then, at the very end, Achilles appears before us in the
interview with Priam, no longer as a petulant spoiled child or fiery
barbarian chief, but as a hero, capable of sacrificing his still fierce
passion for revenge to the nobler emotion of reverence for the age
and sorrow of the sonless king.</p>

<p>The centralization of interest in the character of Achilles constitutes
the grandeur of the <i>Iliad</i>. It is also by this that the <i>Iliad</i>
is distinguished from all the narrative epics of the world. In the
case of all the rest there is one main event, one deed which has
to be accomplished, one series of actions with a definite beginning
and ending. In none else are the passions of the hero made the
main points of the movement. This may be observed at once
by comparing the <i>Iliad</i> with the chief epical poems of European
literature. To begin with the <i>Odyssey</i>. The restoration, after
many wanderings, of Odysseus to his wife and kingdom forms
the subject of this romance. When that has been accomplished,
the <i>Odyssey</i> is completed. In the same way the subject of the
<i>&AElig;neid</i> is the foundation of the Trojan kingdom in Italy. &AElig;neas
is conducted from Troy to Carthage, from Carthage to Latium.
He flies from Dido, because fate has decreed that his empire
should not take root in Africa. He conquers Turnus because it
is destined that he, and not the Latin prince, should be the ancestor
of Roman kings. As soon as Turnus has been killed and
Lavinia has been wedded to &AElig;neas, the action of the poem is
accomplished and the <i>&AElig;neid</i> is completed. When we pass to
modern epics, the first that meets us is the <i>Niebelungen Lied</i>.
Here the action turns upon the murder of Sigfrit by Hagen, and
the vengeance of his bride, Chriemhilt. As soon as Chriemhilt
has assembled her husband's murderers in the halls of King Etzel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and there has compassed their destruction, the subject is complete,
the <i>Niebelungen</i> is at an end. The British epic of the Round
Table, if we may regard Sir Thomas Mallory's <i>Mort d'Arthur</i> as
a poem, centres in the life and predestined death of King Arthur.
Upon the fate of Arthur hangs the whole complex series of events
which compose the romance. His death is its natural climax, for
with him expires the Round Table he had framed to keep the
pagans in awe. After that event nothing remains for the epic
poet to relate. Next in date and importance is the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>
of Ariosto. The action of this poem is bound up with the
destinies of Ruggiero and Bradamante. Their separations and
wanderings supply the main fabric of the plot. When these are
finally ended, and their marriage has been consummated, nothing
remains to be related. The theme of the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>,
again, is the conquest of the Holy City from the Saracens. When
this has been described, there is nothing left for Tasso to tell.
The <i>Paradise Lost</i>, in spite of its more stationary character, does
not differ from this type. It sets forth the single event of the
fall. After Adam and Eve have disobeyed the commands of their
Maker and have been expelled from Eden, the subject is exhausted,
the epic is at an end.</p>

<p>Thus each of these great epic poems has one principal event,
on which the whole action hinges and which leaves nothing more
to be narrated. But with the <i>Iliad</i> it is different. At the end
of the <i>Iliad</i> we leave Achilles with his fate still unaccomplished,
the Trojan war still undecided. The <i>Iliad</i> has no one great external
event or series of events to narrate. It is an episode in the
war of Troy, a chapter in the life of Peleus's son. But it does set
forth, with the vivid and absorbing interest that attaches to true
&aelig;sthetic unity, the character of its hero, selecting for that purpose
the group of incidents which best display it.</p>

<p>The <i>Iliad</i>, therefore, has for its whole subject the passion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Achilles&mdash;that ardent energy or &#924;&#919;&#925;&#921;&#931; of the hero, which displayed
itself first as anger against Agamemnon, and afterwards as
love for the lost Patroclus. The truth of this was perceived by
one of the greatest poets and profoundest critics of the modern
world, Dante. When Dante, in the <i>Inferno</i>, wished to describe
Achilles, he wrote, with characteristic brevity:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">Achille,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Che per amore al fine combatteo.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">Achilles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who at the last was brought to fight by love.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this pregnant sentence Dante sounded the whole depth of
the <i>Iliad</i>. The wrath of Achilles against Agamemnon, which prevented
him at first from fighting; the love of Achilles, passing the
love of women, for Patroclus, which induced him to forego his
anger and to fight at last&mdash;these are the two poles on which the
<i>Iliad</i> turns. Two passions&mdash;heroic anger and measureless love&mdash;in
the breast of the chief actor, are the motive forces of the poem.
It is this simplicity in the structure of the <i>Iliad</i> which constitutes
its nobleness. There is no double plot, no attempt to keep our
interest alive by misunderstandings, or treacheries, or thwartings
of the hero in his aims. These subtleties and resources of art the
poet, whom we will call Homer, for the sake of brevity, discards.
He trusts to the magnitude of his chief actor, to the sublime
central figure of Achilles, for the whole effect of his epic. It is
hardly necessary to insist upon the highly tragic value of this
subject. The destinies of two great nations hang trembling in
the balance. Kings on the earth below, gods in the heavens above,
are moved to turn this way or that the scale of war. Meanwhile
the whole must wait upon the passions of one man. Nowhere
else, in any work of art, has the relation of a single heroic character
to the history of the world been set forth with more of tragic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
pomp and splendid incident. Across the scene on which gods
and men are contending in fierce rivalry moves the lustrous figure
of Achilles, ever potent, ever young, but with the ash-white
aureole of coming death around his forehead. He too is in the
clutch of destiny. As the price of his decisive action, he must
lay his life down and retire with sorrow to the shades. It is thus
that in the very dawn of civilization the Greek poet divined the
pathos and expounded the philosophy of human life, showing
how the fate of nations may depend upon the passions of a man,
who in his turn is but the creature of a day, a ripple on the stream
of time. Nothing need be said by the &aelig;sthetic critic about the
solar theory, which pretends to explain the tale of Troy. The
mythus of Achilles may possibly in very distant ages have expressed
some simple astronomical idea. But for a man to think
of this with the actual <i>Iliad</i> before his eyes would be about as
bad as botanizing on his mother's grave. Homer was not thinking
of the sun when he composed the <i>Iliad</i>. He wove, as in a
web, all elements of tragic pity and fear, pathos and passion, and
fateful energy which constitute the dramas of nations and of men.</p>

<p>In the two passions, anger and love, which form the prominent
features of the character of Achilles, there is nothing small or
mean. Anger has scarcely less right than ambition to be styled
the last infirmity of noble minds. And love, when it gives the
motive force to great action, is sublime. The love of Achilles
had no softness or effeminacy. The wrath of Achilles never degenerated
into savagery. Both of these passions, instead of weakening
the hero, add force to his activity. Homer has traced the
outlines of the portrait of Achilles so largely that criticism can
scarcely avoid dwarfing them. In looking closely at the picture,
there is a danger lest, while we examine the parts, we should fail
to seize the greatness of the whole. It is better to bring together
in rapid succession those passages of the <i>Iliad</i> which display the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
character of Achilles under the double aspect of anger and love.
The first scene (i. 148-246) shows us Agamemnon surrounded by
the captains of the Greek host, holding the same position among
them as Charlemagne among his peers, or King John among the
English barons. They recognize his heaven-descended right of
monarchy; but their allegiance holds by a slight thread. They
are not afraid of bearding him, browbeating him with threats, and
roundly accusing him of his faults. This turbulent feudal society
has been admirably sketched by Marlowe in <i>Edward II.</i>, and by
Shakespeare in <i>Richard II.</i> And it must be remembered that between
Agamemnon and the Hellenic &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#962; there was not even
so much as a feudal bond of fealty. Calchas has just told Agamemnon
that, in order to avert the plague, Chryseis must be restored
to her father. The king has answered that if he is forced
to relinquish her, the Greeks must indemnify him richly. Then
the anger of Achilles boils over:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Ah, clothed upon with impudence and greedy-souled! How, thinkest
thou, can man of the Achaians with glad heart follow at thy word to take the
field or fight the foe? Not for the quarrel of the warlike Trojans did I come
unto these shores, for they had wronged me not. They never drove my cattle
nor my steeds, nor ever, in rich, populous Phthia, did they waste the corn;
since far between us lie both shadowy mountains and a sounding sea: but
following thee, thou shameless king, we came to gladden thee, for Menelaus
and for thee, thou hound, to win you fame from Troy. Of this thou reckest
not and hast no care. Yea, and behold thou threatenest even from me to
wrest my guerdon with thy hands, for which I sorely strove, and which the
sons of the Achaians gave to me. Never, in sooth, do I take equally with
thee, when Achaians sack a well-walled Trojan town. My hands do all the
work of furious war; but when division comes, thy guerdon is far greater,
and I go back with small but well-loved treasure to the ships, tired out with
fighting. Now, lo! I am again for Phthia; for better far, I ween, it is homeward
to sail with beaked ships: nor do I think that if I stay unhonored wilt
thou get much wealth and gain.</p>

<p>"Him, then, in answer, Agamemnon, king of men, bespake:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
<p>"Away! fly, if thy soul is set on flying. I beg thee not to stay for me.
With me are many who will honor me, and most of all, the Counsellor Zeus.
Most hateful to me of the Zeus-born kings art thou. Forever dost thou love
strife, warfare, wrangling. If very stout of limb thou art, that did God give
thee. Go home, then, with thy ships and friends. Go, rule the Myrmidones.
I care not for thee, nor regard thy wrath, but this will I threaten&mdash;since Ph&#339;bus
robs me of Chryseis, her with my ship and with my followers will I send;
but I will take fair-cheeked Briseis, thy own prize, and fetch her from thy
tent, that thou mayest know how far thy better I am, and that others too may
dread to call themselves my equal, and to paragon themselves with me.</p>

<p>"So spake he. And Peleides was filled with grief; and his heart within
his shaggy bosom was cut in twain with thought, whether to draw his sharp
sword from his thigh, and, breaking through the heroes, kill the king, or to
stay his anger and refrain his soul. While thus he raged within his heart
and mind, and from its scabbard was in act to draw the mighty sword, came
Athene from heaven; for Here, white-armed goddess, sent her forth, loving
both heroes in her soul, and caring for them. She stood behind, and took
Peleides by the yellow hair, seen by him only, but of the rest none saw her.
Achilles marvelled, and turned back; and suddenly he knew Pallas Athene,
and awful seemed her eyes to him; and, speaking winged words, he thus addressed
her:</p>

<p>"Why, daughter of &aelig;gis-bearing Zeus, art thou come hither? Say, is it
to behold the violence of Agamemnon, Atreus's son? But I will tell to thee,
what verily I think shall be accomplished, that by his own pride he soon shall
slay his soul.</p>

<p>"Him then the gray-eyed goddess Athene bespake:</p>

<p>"I came to stay thy might, if thou wilt hear me, from heaven; for Here,
white-armed goddess, sent me forth, loving you both alike, and caring for you.
But come, give up strife, nor draw thy sword! But, lo, I bid thee taunt him
with sharp words, as verily shall be. For this I say to thee, and it shall be
accomplished: the time shall come when thou shalt have thrice-fold as many
splendid gifts because of his violence. Only restrain thyself; obey me.</p>

<p>"To her, in turn, spake swift-footed Achilles:</p>

<p>"Needs must I, goddess, keep thy word and hers, though sorely grieved in
soul; for thus is it best. He who obeys the gods, him have they listened to
in time of need.</p>

<p>"He spake, and on the silver handle pressed a heavy hand, and back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the scabbard thrust the mighty sword, nor swerved from Athene's counsel.
But she back to Olympus fared, to the house of &aelig;gis-bearing Zeus unto the
other gods.</p>

<p>"Then Peleides again with bitter words bespake Atrides, and not yet
awhile surceased from wrath:</p>

<p>"Wine-weighted, with a dog's eyes and a heart of deer! Never hadst thou
spirit to harness thee for the battle with the folk, nor yet to join the ambush
with the best of the Achaians. <i>This</i> to thee seems certain death. Far better
is it, verily, throughout the broad camp of Achaians to filch gifts when a
man stands up to speak against thee&mdash;thou folk-consuming king, that swayest
men of nought. Lo, of a sooth, Atrides, now for the last time wilt thou have
dealt knavishly. But I declare unto thee, and will swear thereon a mighty
oath; yea, by this sceptre, which shall never put forth leaf nor twig since that
day that it left the stock upon the mountains, nor again shall bud or bloom,
for of its leafage and its bark the iron stripped it bare; and sons of the
Achaians hold it in their palms for judgment, they who guard the laws by
ordinance of Zeus; and this shall be to thee a mighty oath. Verily, and of
a truth, the day shall be when sore desire for Achilles shall come upon Achaians
one and all. Then shalt thou, though grieved in soul, have no power to
help, while in multitudes they fall and die at Hector's murderous hands; but
thou shalt tear thy heart within thy breast for rage, seeing thou honoredst
not the best of the Achaians aught.</p>

<p>"So spake Peleides; and on the earth cast down the sceptre studded with
nails of gold; and he sat down upon his seat."</p></div>

<p>What is chiefly noticeable in this passage is the grand scale
upon which the anger of Achilles is displayed. He is not content
with taunting Agamemnon, but he includes all the princes
in his scorn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#946;&#8057;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8059;&#962;, &#7952;&#960;&#949;&#8054; &#959;&#8016;&#964;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#8150;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#8049;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We may also notice the interference of Athene. The Athene
of the <i>Iliad</i> is a different goddess from the Athene of the Parthenon.
In strength she is more than a match for Ares. Her
cunning she subordinates to great and masculine ends, not to the
arts of beauty or to study. She is the saint of the valiant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
wary soldier. While checking Achilles, she does not advise him
to avoid strife in any meek and gentle spirit. She simply reminds
him that if he gets to blows with Agamemnon, he will put
himself in the wrong; whereas, by contenting himself with sharp
words and with secession from the war, he will reduce the haughty
king to sue him with gifts and submission. Athene in this
place acts like all the other deities in Homer when they come
into direct contact with the heroes. She is exterior to Achilles,
and at the same time a part of his soul. She is the expression
of both thought and passion deeply seated in his nature, the force
of his own character developed by circumstance, the god within
his breast externalized and rendered visible to him alone. What
Athene is to the son of Peleus, At&eacute; is to Agamemnon.</p>

<p>The next passage in which Achilles appears in the forefront of
the scene is in the ninth book (307-429). Worn out with the
losses of the war, Agamemnon has at last humbled his pride, and
sent the wisest of the chiefs, silver-tongued Odysseus, and Ph&#339;nix,
the old guardian of the son of Peleus, to beg Achilles to
receive back Briseis and to take great gifts if only he will relax
his wrath. But Achilles remains inflexible. In order to maintain
the firmness of his character, to justify the righteousness of
his indignation, Homer cannot suffer him to abandon his resentment
at the first entreaty. Some more potent influence must
break his resolution than the mere offer to restore Briseis. Homer
has the death of Patroclus in the background. He means to
show the iron heart of Peleides at last softened by his sorrow
and his love. Therefore, for the time, he must protract the situation
in which Achilles is still haughty, still implacable towards
his repentant injurer. In this interview with the ambassadors we
have to observe how confident Achilles abides in the justice of
his cause and in his own prowess. It is he with his valiant bands
who has sacked the Trojan cities; it is he who kept Hector from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the ships; and now in his absence the Achaians have had to build
a wall in self-defence. And for whom has he done this? For
the sons of Atreus and for Helen. And what has he received as
guerdon? Nothing but dishonor. These arguments might seem
to savor too much of egotism and want of feeling for the dangers
of the host. But at the end come those great lines upon the
vanity of gifts and possessions in comparison with life, and upon
the doom which hangs above the hero:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You may make oxen and sheep your prey; you may gather together tripods
and the tawny mane of horses; but none can make the soul of man return
by theft or craft when once it has escaped. As for me," he resumes,
"my goddess mother, silver-footed Thetis, warns me that fate lays two paths
to bear me deathward. If I abide and fight before the walls of Troy, my return
to Hellas is undone, but fame imperishable remains for me. If I return
to my dear country then my good glory dies, but long life awaits me, nor will
the term of death be hastened."</p></div>

<p>This foreknowledge of Achilles that he has to choose between
a long, inglorious life and a swift-coming but splendid death
illuminates his ultimate action with a fateful radiance. In the
passage before us it lends dignity to his obstinate and obdurate
endurance. He says: I am sick at heart for the insults thrust
on me. I am wounded in my pride. Toiling for others, I get
no reward. And behold, if I begin to act again, swift death is
before me. Shall I, to please Agamemnon, hasten on my own
end?</p>

<p>When the moment arrives for Achilles to be aroused from inactivity
by his own noblest passion, then, and not till then, does he
fling aside the thought of death, and trample on a long reposeful
life. He is conscious that his glory can only be achieved by the
sacrifice of ease and happiness and life itself; but he holds honor
dearer than these good things. Yet, at the same time, he is not
eager to throw away his life for a worthless object, or to buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
mere fame by an untimely end. It requires another motive&mdash;the
strong pressure of sorrow and remorse&mdash;to quicken his resolution;
but when once quickened, nothing can retard it. Achilles
at this point might be compared to a mass of ice and snow hanging
at the jagged edge of a glacier, suspended on a mountain
brow. We have seen such avalanches brooding upon Monte
Rosa, or the Jungfrau, beaten by storms, loosened, perchance, by
summer sun, but motionless. In a moment a lightning-flash
strikes the mass, and it roars crumbling to the deep.</p>

<p>This lightning-flash in the case of Achilles was the death of
Patroclus (xviii. 15). Patroclus has gone forth to aid the Achaians
and has fallen beneath Hector's sword. Antilochus, sent to
bear the news to Achilles, finds him standing before the ships,
already anxious about the long delay of his comrade. Antilochus
does not break the news gently. His tears betray the import of
his message, and he begins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Woe is me, son of brave Peleus! Verily thou shalt hear right sorrowful
tidings&mdash;Patroclus lies slain; round his corpse they are fighting; stripped it
lies, but plum&egrave;d Hector hath his armor.</p>

<p>"So he spake. But a black cloud of woe covered the hero. With both
hands he took the dust of ashes and flung them down upon his head, and disfigured
his fair face, and on his fragrant tunic lay the black cinders. But he,
huge in his hugeness, stretched upon the dust lay, and with his hands he tore
and ravaged his hair."</p></div>

<p>Thus Achilles receives the first shock of grief. When his
mother rises from the sea to comfort him, he refuses consolation,
and cries:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My mother, the Olympian hath done all these things; but of what pleasure
is this to me, now that my dear friend is dead, Patroclus, whom above all
my comrades I honored, even as myself? Him have I slain!"</p></div>

<p>This is the pith and marrow of his anguish. I slew Patroclus:
it was I who sent him forth to fight. "Now," he resumes a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
lines lower down&mdash;"now my soul bids me no longer live or be
with men, save only I strike Hector first and slay him with my
spear, and make him pay the fine of Patroclus."</p>

<p>Thetis reminds him that if he slay Hector, his own life will
be short. This only serves to turn his anguish into desperate
resolve:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Straight let me die, seeing I might not come to the aid of my comrade
when he was dying. Far from his fatherland he perished. He looked for
me that I should have been his helper. But now, since never to my home
shall I return, nor was I a light in trouble to Patroclus, nor to my other comrades
who are slain by hundreds by the godlike Hector&mdash;while I here sit beside
the ships, a useless load upon the earth&mdash;I who am such as there is none
else like me among brazen-coated Achaians in the war&mdash;others may be better
perchance in council&mdash;now let strife perish from among gods and men, with
anger which stirs up the prudent even to fury."</p></div>

<p>Thus he foregoes his wrath, and flings resentment from him
like a mantle. Then he rises ready for the fight. "If death
come, let death be welcome. Death came to Herakles. In his
due time he comes to me. Meanwhile I thirst to make Dardan
ladies widows in the land."</p>

<p>When he next appears, his very form and outward semblance
are transfigured. He stands alone and unarmed in the trench.
A fire surrounds his head and flames upon his curls. His voice
thrills the armies like the blare of a victorious trumpet. This
is how Homer has described him shouting in the trench (xviii.
203):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"But Achilles, dear to Zeus, arose, and around his mighty shoulders Athene
cast her tasselled &aelig;gis; and about his head the queenly goddess set a crown
of golden mist, and from it she made blaze a dazzling flame. As when smoke
rises to the clear sky from a town, afar from an island which foemen beleaguer,
who all day long contend in grisly war, issuing from their own town;
but at sundown beacons blaze in rows, and on high the glare goes up, and
soars for neighboring men to see, if haply warders-off of woe may come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
them with ships&mdash;so from the head of Achilles the flame went up to heaven.
He stood at the trench, away from the wall, nor joined the Achaians; for he
honored his mother's wise command. There he stood and shouted; and beside
him Pallas Athene cried; but among the Trojans he raised infinite tumult.
As when a mighty voice, when the trumpet shrills for the murderous
foemen that surround a town, so was the mighty voice of the son of &AElig;acus.
They then, when they heard the brazen cry of &AElig;acides, in the breasts of all
of them the heart was troubled; but the fair-maned horses turned the cars
backward; for in their heart they knew the sorrows that were to be. And
the charioteers were stricken when they saw the tireless flame terrible above
the head of big-hearted Peleus's son blazing. The gray-eyed goddess Athene
kindled it. Thrice above the trench shouted the godlike Achilles in his
might; thrice were the Trojans and their noble allies troubled."</p></div>

<p>From this moment the action of the <i>Iliad</i> advances rapidly.
Achilles takes his proper place, and occupies the whole stage.
The body of Patroclus is brought home to him; he mourns over
it, and promises to bury it when he shall have slain Hector,
and slaughtered twelve sons of the Trojans on the pyre. Then
he reconciles himself with Agamemnon, and formally renounces
anger. Lastly, when he has put on the divine armor made for
him by Heph&aelig;stus, he ascends his car, and hastens into the fight.
But again at this point, when Achilles is at the very pitch and
summit of his glory, the voice of fate is heard. It is with the
promise of the tomb that he enters the battle. Turn to book
xix. 399. Achilles has just mounted his chariot:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Fiercely did he cheer the horses of his sire. Xanthus and Balius, far-famed
children of Podarg&eacute;, take other heed, I warn ye, how to save your master,
and to bring him to the Danaan host, returning of war satisfied; nor
leave him, like Patroclus, dead there on the field.</p>

<p>"To him, then, from beneath the yoke spake the fleet-footed horse Xanthus,
and straightway drooped his head; and all his mane, escaping from the
collar by the yoke, fell earthward. Goddess Here, of the white arms, gave
him speech:</p>

<p>"Verily shall we save thee yet this time, fierce Achilles; but close at hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
is thy doomsday. Nor of this are we the cause, but great God in heaven and
resistless fate. For neither was it by our sloth or sluggishness that Trojans
stripped the arms from Patroclus his shoulders; but of gods the best, whom
fair-haired Leto bare, slew him among the foremost, and gave to Hector glory
of the deed. We, though we should run apace with Zephyr's breath, the fleetest,
as 'tis said, yet for thee it is decreed to perish by the might of God and
man.</p>

<p>"When he had thus spoken the Erinnyes stayed his voice; and, high in
wrath, fleet-foot Achilles answered him:</p>

<p>"Xanthus! why prophesy my death? Thou hast no call. Right well
know I, too, that it is my fate to perish here, far from dear sire and mother;
yet for all this will I not surcease before I satiate the Trojans with war.</p>

<p>"He spoke, and vanward held his steeds with mighty yell."</p></div>

<p>This dialogue between Achilles and Xanthus is not without
great importance. Homer is about to show the hero raging in
carnage, exulting over suppliants and slain foes, terrible in his
ferocity. It is consistent with the whole character of Achilles,
who is fiery, of indomitable fury, that he should act thus. Stung
as he is by remorse and by the sorrow for Patroclus, which does
not unnerve him, but rather kindles his whole spirit to a flame,
we are prepared to see him fierce even to cruelty. But when
we know that in the midst of the carnage he is himself moving
a dying man, when we remember that he is sending his slain foes
like messengers before his face to Hades, when we keep the warning
words of Thetis and of Xanthus in our minds, then the grim
frenzy of Achilles becomes dignified. The world is in a manner
over for him, and he appears the incarnation of disdainful anger
and revengeful love, the conscious scourge of God and instrument
of destiny. We need not go through the details of the battle,
in which Achilles drives the Trojans before him, and is only withheld
by the direct interposition of the gods from carrying Ilium
by assault. To borrow a simile from Dante, his foes are like
frogs scurrying away from the approach of their great foe, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
water-snake. Then follow the episode of Lycaon's slaughter, the
fight with the river-gods, and the death of Hector. To the assembled
Greeks Achilles cries (xxii. 386):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"By the ships, a corpse, unburied, unbewailed, lies Patroclus; but of him
I will not be unmindful so long as I abide among the living and my knees
have movement. Nay, should there be oblivion of the dead in Hades, yet I
even there will remember my loved comrade. But rise, ye youths of Achaia,
and singing P&aelig;an, let us hasten to the ships, and take this slain man with us.
Great glory have we got. Divine Hector have we slain, to whom the Trojans
in their city prayed as to a god."</p></div>

<p>So the P&aelig;an rings. But Achilles by the ships, after the hateful
banquet, as he calls it in the sorrowful loathing of all comfort,
has been finished, lays himself to sleep (xxiii. 59):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The son of Peleus by the shore of the roaring sea lay, heavily groaning,
surrounded by his Myrmidons; on a fair space of sand he lay, where the
waves lapped the beach. Then slumber took him, loosing the cares of his
heart, and mantling softly around him; for sorely wearied were his radiant
limbs with driving Hector on by windy Troy. There to him came the soul
of poor Patroclus, in all things like himself&mdash;in stature, and in the beauty of
his eyes and voice; and on his form was raiment like his own. He stood
above the hero's head, and spake to him:</p>

<p>"Sleepest thou, and me hast thou forgotten, Achilles? Not in my life
wert thou neglectful of me, but in death. Bury me soon, that I may pass the
gates of Hades. Far off the souls, the shadows of the dead, repel me, nor
suffer me to join them on the river-bank; but, as it is, thus I roam around
the wide-doored house of Hades. But stretch to me thy hand, I entreat; for
never again shall I return from Hades when once ye shall have given me the
meed of funeral fire. Nay, never shall we sit in life apart from our dear
comrades, and take counsel together. But me hath hateful fate enveloped&mdash;fate
that was mine at the moment of my birth. And for thyself, divine
Achilles, it is doomed to die before the noble Trojans' wall. Another thing I
will say to thee, and bid thee do it if thou wilt obey me: Lay not my bones
apart from thine, Achilles, but lay them together; for we were brought up
together in your house, when Men&#339;tius brought me, a child, from Opus to
your house, because of woful bloodshed on the day in which I slew the son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of Amphidamas, myself a child, not willing it, but in anger at our games. Then
did the horseman, Peleus, take me, and rear me in his house, and cause me to
be called thy squire. So, then, let one grave also hide the bones of both of
us, the golden urn thy goddess-mother gave to thee.</p>

<p>"Him answered swift-footed Achilles:</p>

<p>"Why, dearest and most honored, hast thou hither come, to lay on me this
thy behest? All things most certainly will I perform, and bow to what thou
biddest. But stand thou near: even for one moment let us throw our arms
upon each other's neck, and take our fill of sorrowful wailing.</p>

<p>"So spake he, and with his outstretched hands he clasped, but could not
seize. The spirit, earthward, like smoke, vanished with a shriek. Then all
astonished arose Achilles, and beat his palms together, and spoke a piteous
word:</p>

<p>"Heavens! is there, then, among the dead soul and the shade of life, but
thought is theirs no more at all? For through the night the soul of poor
Patroclus stood above my head, wailing and sorrowing loud, and bade me do
his will. It was the very semblance of himself.</p>

<p>"So spake he, and in the hearts of all of them he raised desire of lamentation;
and while they were yet mourning, to them appeared rose-fingered dawn
about the piteous corpse."</p></div>

<p>There is surely nothing more thrilling in its pathos throughout
the whole range of poetry than this scene, in which the iron-hearted
conqueror of Hector holds ineffectual communing in
dreams with his dear, lost, never-to-be-forgotten friend. But now
the pyre is ready to be heaped, and the obsequies of Patroclus
are on the point of being celebrated. Thereupon Achilles cuts
his tawny curls, which he wore clustering for Spercheius, and
places them in the hand of dead Patroclus. At the sight of this
token that Achilles will return no more to Hellas, but that he
must die and lie beside his friend, all the people fall to lamentation.
Agamemnon has to arouse them to prepare the pyre. A
hundred feet each way is it built up; oxen and sheep are slaughtered
and placed upon the wood, with jars of honey and olive-oil.
Horses, too, and dogs are slain to serve the dead man on his jour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>ney;
and twelve sons of the great-souled Trojans are sacrificed to
the disconsolate ghost. Then Achilles cast fire upon the wood,
and wailed, and called on his loved friend by name:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Hail, Patroclus! I greet thee even in the tomb: for now I am performing
all that erst I promised. Twelve valiant sons of the great-souled Trojans
with thee the fire devours; but Hector, son of Priam, I will give to no fire to
feed on, but to dogs."</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile the pyre of Patroclus refused to burn, and Achilles
summoned the two winds, Boreas and Zephyrus, to help him.
They at this time were feasting in the house of Zephyrus, and
Iris had to fetch them from their cups. They rose and drove the
clouds before them, and furrowed up the sea, and passed to fertile
Troy, and fell upon the pyre, and the great flame crackled, hugely
blazing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"All night they around the pyre together cast a flame, blowing with shrill
breath, and all night swift Achilles, from a golden bowl, holding a double
goblet, drew wine, and poured it on the ground, and soaked the earth, calling
upon the soul of poor Patroclus. As when a father wails who burns the
bones of his son unwed, so wailed Achilles, burning his friend's bones, pacing
slowly round the fire, and uttering groan on groan.</p>

<p>"But when the star of dawn came to herald light upon the earth, whom
following morn, with saffron robe, spread across the sea, then the pyre languished
and the flame was stayed.</p>

<p>"The winds again went homeward, back across the Thracian deep. It
groaned beneath them, raging with the billow's swell. But the son of Peleus
turned from the pyre, and lay down weary, and sweet sleep came upon him."</p></div>

<p>After this manner was the burning of Patroclus. And here
the action of the <i>Iliad</i> may be said to end. What follows in
the last two books is, however, of the greatest importance in adding
dignity to the character of Achilles, and in producing that
sense of repose, that pacification of the more violent emotions,
which we require in the highest works of tragic art. First come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the games around the barrow of Patroclus. Presiding over them
is Achilles, who opens his treasure-house to the combatants with
royal generosity, forever mindful that in honoring them he is paying
honor to the great sad ghost of his dead friend. The bitterness
of his sorrow is past; his thirst for vengeance is assuaged.
Radiant and tranquil he appears among the chiefs of the Achaians;
and to Agamemnon he displays marked courtesy.</p>

<p>But it is not enough to show us Achilles serene in the accomplishment
of his last service to Patroclus. As the crowning scene
in the whole <i>Iliad</i>, Homer has contrived to make us feel that, after
all, Achilles is a man. The wrathful and revengeful hero, who
bearded Agamemnon on his throne, and who slew the unarmed
suppliant Lycaon, relents in pity at a father's prayer. Priam, in
the tent of Achilles, presents one of the most touching pictures to
be found in poetry. We know the leonine fierceness of Achilles;
we know how he has cherished the thought of insult to dead
Hector as a final tribute to his friend: even now he is brooding
in his lair over the Trojan corpse. Into this lion's den the old
king ventures. Instead of springing on him, as we might have
feared, Achilles is found sublime in generosity of soul. Begging
Patroclus to forgive him for robbing his ghost of this last satisfaction,
he relinquishes to Priam the body of his son. Yet herein
there is nothing sentimental. Achilles is still the same&mdash;swift
to anger and haughty, but human withal, and tender-hearted to
the tears of an enemy at his mercy.</p>

<p>This is the last mention made of Achilles in the <i>Iliad</i>. The
hero, whom we have seen so noble in his interview with Priam,
was destined within a few days to die before the walls of Troy,
slain by the arrow of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> His ashes were mingled with those
of Patroclus. In their death they were not divided.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>Once again in the Homeric poems does Achilles appear. But
this time he is a ghost among the pale shadows of Elysium (<i>Od.</i>
xi. 466):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thereupon came the soul of Achilles, son of Peleus, and of Patroclus,
and of brave Antilochus, and of Ajax, who was first in form and stature
among the Achaians after great Peleides. The soul of fleet &AElig;acides knew
me, and, wailing, he thus spake:</p>

<p>"Zeus-born son of Laertes, wily Ulysses, why in thy heart, unhappy man,
dost thou design a deed too great for mortals? How darest thou descend to
Hades, where dwell the thoughtless dead, the phantoms of men whose life is
done?</p>

<p>"So he spake; but I in turn addressed him:</p>

<p>"Achilles, son of Peleus, greatest by far of Achaians, I am come to learn
of Teiresias concerning my return to Ithaca. But none of men in elder days,
or of those to be, is more blessed than thou art, Achilles; for in life the Argives
honored thee like a god, and now again in thy greatness thou rulest the
dead here where thou art. Therefore be not grieved at death, Achilles.</p>

<p>"So spake I, and he straightway made answer:</p>

<p>"Console not me in death, noble Odysseus! Would rather that I were a
bondsman of the glebe, the servant of a master, of some poor man, whose
living were but scanty, than thus to be the king of all the nations of the
dead."</p></div>

<p>Some apology may be needed for these numerous quotations
from a poem which is hardly less widely known and read than
Shakespeare or the Bible. By no other method, however, would
it have been possible to bring out into prominence the chief features
of the hero whom Homer thought sufficient for the subject
of the greatest epic of the world. For us Achilles has yet another
interest. He, more than any character of fiction, reflects the
qualities of the Greek race in its heroic age. His vices of passion
and ungovernable pride, his virtue of splendid human heroism,
his free individuality asserted in the scorn of fate, are representative
of that Hellas which afterwards, at Marathon and Salamis,
was destined to inaugurate a new era of spiritual freedom for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
mankind. It is impossible for us to sympathize with him wholly,
or to admire him otherwise than as we admire a supreme work of
art; so far is he removed from our so-called proprieties of moral
taste and feeling. But we can study in him the type of a by-gone,
infinitely valuable period of the world's life, of that age in which
the human spirit was emerging from the confused passions and
sordid needs of barbarism into the higher emotions and more refined
aspirations of civilization. Of this dawn, this boyhood of
humanity, Achilles is the fierce and fiery hero. He is the ideal
of a race not essentially moral or political, of a nation which subordinated
morals to art, and politics to personality; and even of
that race he idealizes the youth rather than the manhood. In
some respects Odysseus is a truer representative of the delicate
and subtle spirit which survived all changes in the Greeks. But
Achilles, far more than Odysseus, is an impersonation of the Hellenic
genius, superb in its youthfulness, doomed to immature decay,
yet brilliant at every stage of its brief career.</p>

<p>To exaggerate the importance of Achilles in the education of
the Greeks, who used the <i>Iliad</i> as their Bible, and were keenly
sensitive to all artistic influences, would be difficult. He was the
incarnation of their chivalry, the fountain of their sense of honor.
The full development of this subject would require more space
than I can here give to it. It will be enough to touch upon the
friendship of Achilles for Patroclus as the central point of Hellenic
chivalry; and to advert to the reappearance of his type of
character in Alexander at the very moment when the force of
Hellas seemed to be exhausted.</p>

<p>Nearly all the historians of Greece have failed to insist upon
the fact that fraternity in arms played for the Greek race the same
part as the idealization of women for the knighthood of feudal
Europe. Greek mythology and history are full of tales of friendship,
which can only be paralleled by the story of David and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Jonathan in our Bible. The legends of Herakles and Hylas, of
Theseus and Peirithous, of Apollo and Hyacinth, of Orestes and
Pylades, occur immediately to the mind. Among the noblest
patriots, tyrannicides, law-givers, and self-devoted heroes in the
early times of Greece, we always find the names of friends and
comrades recorded with peculiar honor. Harmodius and Aristogeiton,
who slew the despot Hipparchus at Athens; Diocles and
Philolaus, who gave laws to Thebes; Chariton and Melanippus,
who resisted the sway of Phalaris in Sicily; Cratinus and Aristodemus,
who devoted their lives to propitiate offended deities when
a plague had fallen upon Athens&mdash;these comrades, stanch to each
other in their love, and elevated by friendship to the pitch of noblest
enthusiasm, were among the favorite saints of Greek legendary
history. In a word, the chivalry of Hellas found its motive
force in friendship rather than in the love of women; and the
motive force of all chivalry is a generous, soul-exalting, unselfish
passion. The fruit which friendship bore among the Greeks was
courage in the face of danger, indifference to life when honor was
at stake, patriotic ardor, the love of liberty, and lion-hearted rivalry
in battle. "Tyrants," said Plato, "stand in awe of friends."</p>

<p>It may seem at first sight paradoxical to speak at all of Greek
chivalry, since this word, by its very etymology, is appropriated
to a medi&aelig;val institution. Yet when we inquire what chivalry
means, we find that it implies a permanent state of personal emotion,
which raises human life above the realities of every-day experience,
and inspires men with unselfish impulses. Furthermore,
this passionate condition of the soul in chivalry is connected with
a powerful military enthusiasm, severing the knight from all vile
things, impelling him to the achievement of great deeds, and
breeding in his soul a self-regardless temper. Both the ancient
and the medi&aelig;val forms of chivalry included love and arms. The
heroes and the knights alike were lovers and warriors. The pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>sion
which Plato called madness in the <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i>, and which the
Proven&ccedil;al troubadours knew by the name of <i>Joie</i>, was excited in
the heroes by their friends, and in the knights by their ladies.
But the emotion was substantially the same; nor, with the tale
of Patroclus and with the whole of Greek history before us, can
we allow our modern inaptitude for devoted friendship to blind
us to the seriousness of this passion among the Greeks. Besides
war and love, chivalry implies a third enthusiasm. In the case of
the Greek heroes this was patriotic; in the case of the medi&aelig;val
knights it was religious. Thus, antique chivalry may be described
as a compound of military, amatory, and patriotic passions meeting
in one enthusiastic habit of the soul; medi&aelig;val chivalry as a
compound of military, amatory, and religious passions meeting in
a similar enthusiastic habit of soul. It is hardly necessary to
point out the differences between Hellenic heroism and Teutonic
knighthood, or to show how far the former failed to influence society
as favorably as the latter. The Christian chivalry of mercy,
forgiveness, gentleness, and long-suffering, which claims the title
of charity in armor, was a post-Hellenic ideal. Greeks could not
have comprehended the oath which Arthur imposed upon his
knights, and which ran in the following words: "He charged
them never to do outrage nor murder, and alway to flee treason;
also by no means to be cruel, but to give mercy unto him that
asked mercy, and alway to do ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen
succor upon pain of death." The murder of Lycaon by Achilles,
the butchery of Dolon by Diomedes, and the treachery practised
upon Philoctetes by Odysseus are sufficiently at variance with the
spirit of this oath; nor do any of the heroic legends tell a tale of
courtesy towards women. Thus much about the unchivalrous aspects
of Greek heroism I have thought it right to say, before returning
to the view which I first stated, that military friendship
among the Greeks played for Hellenic civilization a part not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
wholly dissimilar to that of chivalrous love among the nations of
medi&aelig;val Europe. Regarded as an institution, with ethics of its
own, and with peculiar social and political regulations, this Greek
chivalry was specially Dorian.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Yet it spread through all the
states of Hellas. In Athens it allied itself with philosophy, as afterwards
at Florence did the chivalry of knighthood; and in
Thebes, during the last struggle for Hellenic freedom, it blazed
forth in the heroism of the three hundred, who fell together face-forward
to the Macedonian lances at Ch&aelig;ronea.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Meanwhile,
Achilles remained for all Greece the eponym of passionate friendship;
and even in the later periods of Greek poetry the most appropriate
title for a pair of noble comrades was "Achilleian."
Concerning the abuse and debasement of such passion among the
historic Greeks, this is not the place to speak. Achilles and Patroclus
cannot be charged with having sanctioned by example any
vice, however much posterity may have read its own moods of
thought and feeling into Homer.</p>

<p>&AElig;schylus wrote a tragedy entitled the <i>Myrmidones</i>, in commemoration
of the love of Achilles; and, perhaps, few things
among the lost treasures of Greek literature are so much to be regretted
as this play, which would have cast clear light upon the
most romantic of Greek legends. It may also be mentioned in
passing that we possess fragments of a play of Sophocles which
bears the name &#7944;&#967;&#953;&#955;&#955;&#8051;&#969;&#962; &#7956;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;, or <i>Lovers of Achilles</i>; but what
its subject was, and whether the drama was satyric, as seems probable,
or not, we do not know. The beautiful passage in which
love is compared to a piece of glittering ice held in the hand of
children, has been preserved from it by Stob&aelig;us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Enough, fortunately, has survived the ruin of time to enable us
to conjecture how &AElig;schylus, in the <i>Myrmidones</i>, handled the materials
afforded him by Homer. The play, as was frequent, took
its name from the chorus who represented the contingent of
Thessalian warriors led by Peleus's son against Troy. It opened,
if we may trust the scholiast to the <i>Frogs</i> of Aristophanes, with a
reproach uttered by the chorus against Achilles for his inactivity:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#964;&#8049;&#948;&#949; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#955;&#949;&#8059;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;, &#966;&#945;&#8055;&#948;&#953;&#956;' &#7944;&#967;&#953;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#8166;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#948;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#916;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#8182;&#957; &#956;&#8057;&#967;&#952;&#959;&#965;&#962;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#959;&#8019;&#962; ... &#949;&#7988;&#963;&#969; &#954;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#8055;&#945;&#962;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Seest thou these things, glorious Achilles&mdash;the sufferings of
the Danaans beneath victorious spears? Whom thou within thy
tent&mdash;" Here the fragment breaks off; but enough has been said
to strike the keynote of the tragedy. The next fragment, according
to Dindorf's arrangement, formed, probably, part of Achilles'
defence.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It is written in iambics, and contains the famous simile
of the eagle stricken to death by an arrow fledged with his
own feather. Like that eagle, argues the hero, have we Greeks
been smitten by our own ill-counsel. After the drama has thus
been opened, the first great incident seems to have been the arrival
of the embassy of Ph&#339;nix at Achilles' tent. One corrupt,
but precious fragment, put by Aristophanes as a quotation into
the mouth of Euripides in the <i>Frogs</i>, indicates the line of argument
taken by the ambassadors:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Though the Greek as it stands is untranslatable, the meaning is
pretty clearly this: Achilles of Phthia, how can you bear to hear
of these woes nor lend a helping hand? The next fragment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>must be received with caution. It occurs in the <i>Frogs</i> as a quotation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#914;&#8051;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#954;' &#7944;&#967;&#953;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#8058;&#962; &#948;&#8059;&#959; &#954;&#8059;&#946;&#969; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8051;&#964;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#945;.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Achilles has cast two dice, and four.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On which the scholiast makes the following remark: "This is
from the <i>Myrmidones</i>; for the poet feigned them playing dice;
and it is the custom of gamesters to cry thus: two, four, three,
five. Dionysus says this to show that &AElig;schylus has won." Another
scholiast puts it in doubt whether the verse be taken from
the <i>Telephus</i> of Euripides or some other source. The foundation
is, therefore, too slender to build upon securely; else we might
imagine that, after the departure of the ambassadors, and perhaps
after the equipment of Patroclus for the war, Achilles was represented
by &AElig;schylus as whiling away the time with his companions
at a game of hazard. Then enters Antilochus, the messenger
of bad news. He recites the death of Patroclus, and lifts up his
voice in lamentation. Our next fragment brings the whole scene
vividly before us:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#7944;&#957;&#964;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#967;', &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#8055;&#956;&#969;&#958;&#8057;&#957; &#956;&#949; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#949;&#952;&#957;&#951;&#954;&#8057;&#964;&#959;&#962;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#950;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The words are spoken undoubtedly by Achilles: "Antilochus,
wail thou for me rather than for the dead&mdash;for me who live." It
is again from a comedy of Aristophanes, the <i>Ecclesiazus&aelig;</i>, that
this exclamation comes; and in passing we may remark that such
frequent citations from this single play of &AElig;schylus by a comic
poet prove its popularity at Athens. Between the narration of
Antilochus and the bringing-in of the dead body of Patroclus
there must have been a solemn pause in the dramatic action,
which &AElig;schylus, no doubt, filled up with one of his great choric
passages. Then followed the crowning scene in the tragedy.
Achilles, front to front with the corpse of his friend, uttered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
lamentation, which the ancients seem to have regarded as the
very ecstasy of grief and love and passionate remembrance. Lucian,
quoting one of the lines of this lament, introduces it with
words that prove the strong impression it produced: "Achilles,
when he bemoaned Patroclus's death, in his unhusbanded passion
burst forth into the very truth." To quote and comment upon
the three lines which have been preserved from this unique Threnos
would be here impossible. To understand them at all is difficult,
and to recompose from them the hero's speech is beyond our
power. The value of the meagre and conflicting citations given
by Plutarch, Athen&aelig;us, and Lucian lies in the impression they
convey of the deep effect wrought upon Greek sympathy by the
passion of the soliloquy. When we call to mind the lamentation
uttered by Teucer over the corpse of Ajax in the tragedy of Sophocles,
we may imagine how the genius of &AElig;schylus rose to the
height of this occasion in his <i>Myrmidones</i>. In what way the
drama ended is not known. We may, however, hazard a conjecture
that the poet did not leave the hero without some outlook
into the future, and that the solemn note of reconciliation upon
which the tragedy closed responded to the first querulous interrogation
of the chorus at its commencement. The situation was a
grand one for working out that purification of the passions which
Greek tragedy required. The sullen and selfish wrath of Achilles
had brought its bitter consequence of suffering and sorrow for the
hero, as well as of disaster for the host. Out of that deadly suffering
of Achilles&mdash;out of the paroxysm of grief beside the body
of his friend&mdash;has grown a nobler form of anger, which will bring
salvation to his country at the certain loss of his own life. Can
we doubt that &AElig;schylus availed himself of this so solemn and
sublime a cadence? The dead march and the funeral lamentations
for Patroclus mingle with the neighing of war-horses and
the braying of the trumpets that shall lead the Myrmidons to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
war. And over and above all sounds of the grief that is passed
and of the triumph that is to follow is heard the voice of fate
pronouncing the death-doom of the hero, on whose &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8055;&#945; the
tragic movement has depended.</p>

<p>Thus, in the prime of Athens, the poet-warrior of Marathon,
the prophet of the highest Hellenic inspiration, handled a legend
which was dear to his people, and which to them spoke more,
perhaps, than it can do to us. Plato, discussing the <i>Myrmidones</i>
of &AElig;schylus, remarks in the <i>Symposium</i> that the tragic poet was
wrong to make Achilles the lover of Patroclus, seeing that Patroclus
was the elder of the two, and that Achilles was the youngest
and most beautiful of all the Greeks. The fact, however, is
that Homer himself raises no question in our minds about the relations
of lover and beloved. Achilles and Patroclus are comrades.
Their friendship is equal. It was only the reflective activity
of the Greek mind, working upon the Homeric legend by
the light of subsequent custom, which introduced these distinctions.
The humanity of Homer was purer, larger, and more sane
than that of his posterity among the Hellenes. Still, it may be
worth while suggesting that Homer, perhaps, intended in Hector
and Achilles to contrast domestic love with the love of comrades.
The tenderness of Hector for Andromache, side by side with the
fierce passion of Achilles, seems to account, at least in some measure,
for the preference felt for Hector in the Middle Ages. Achilles
controlled the Greek imagination. Hector attracted the sympathies
of medi&aelig;val chivalry, and took his place upon the list of
knightly worthies.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Masculine love was Hellenic. The love of
idealized womanhood was romantic. Homer, the sovereign poet,
understood both passions of the human heart, delineating the one
in Achilles without effeminacy, the other in Hector without sickly
sentiment. At the same time, Hector's connection with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>destinies of Rome and his appearance in the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, if only as a
ghost, must not be forgotten when we estimate the reasons why
he eclipsed Achilles in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>It is not till we reach Alexander the Great that we find how
truly Achilles was the type of the Greek people, and to what extent
he had controlled their growth. Alexander expressed in real
life that ideal which in Homer's poetry had been displayed by
Achilles. Alexander set himself to imitate Achilles. His tutor,
Lysimachus, found favor in the eyes of the royal family of Macedon,
by comparing Philip to Peleus, his son to Achilles, and himself
to Ph&#339;nix. On all his expeditions Alexander carried with
him a copy of the <i>Iliad</i>, calling it "a perfect portable treasure of
military virtue." It was in the spirit of the Homeric age that
he went forth to conquer Asia. And when he reached the plain
of Troy, it was to the tomb of Achilles that he paid special homage.
There he poured libations to the mighty ghost, anointed
his grave, and, as Plutarch says, "ran naked about his tomb, and
crowned it with garlands, declaring how happy he esteemed him
in having, while he lived, so faithful a friend, and, when he was
dead, so famous a poet to proclaim his actions." We have seen
that the two chief passions of Achilles were his anger and his
love. In both of these Alexander followed him. The passage
just quoted from Plutarch hints at the envy with which Alexander
regarded the friendship of Achilles and Patroclus. In his
own life he entertained for Heph&aelig;stion a like passion. When
Heph&aelig;stion died of fever at Ecbatana, Alexander exaggerated the
fury and the anguish of the son of Peleus. He went forth and
slew a whole tribe&mdash;the Cosseans&mdash;as a sacrifice to the soul of his
comrade. He threw down the battlements of neighboring cities,
and forbade all signs of merry-making in his camp. Meanwhile
he refused food and comfort, till an oracle from Ammon ordained
that divine honors should be paid Heph&aelig;stion. Then Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
raised a pyre, like that of Patroclus in the <i>Iliad</i>, except that the
pyre of Heph&aelig;stion cost 10,000 talents, and was adorned with
all the splendor of Greek art in its prime. Here the Homeric
ceremonies were performed. Games and races took place; then,
like Achilles, having paid this homage to his friend, of bloodshed,
costly gifts, and obsequies, Alexander at last rested from his grief.
In this extravagance of love for a friend we see the direct working
of the <i>Iliad</i> on the mind of the Macedonian king. But the
realities of life fall far short of the poet's dream. Neither the
love nor the sorrow of Alexander for Heph&aelig;stion is so touching
as the love and sorrow of Achilles for Patroclus.</p>

<p>In his wrath, again, Alexander imitated and went beyond his
model. When he slew Clitus in a drunken brawl, there was no
Athene at his side to stay his arm and put the sword back in the
scabbard. Yet his remorse was some atonement for his violence.
"All that night," says Plutarch, "and the next day he wept bitterly,
till, being quite spent with lamenting and exclaiming, he
lay, as it were, speechless, only fetching deep sighs." It is noticeable
that Alexander, here also like Achilles, conqueror and
hero though he was, scorned not to show his tears, and to grovel
on the ground in anguish. His fiery temper added indomitable
energy to all he did or felt. In a few years he swept Asia, destroying
kingdoms, and founding cities that still bear his name; and
though his rage betrayed him now and then into insane acts, he,
like Achilles, was not wholly without the guidance of Athene.
In both we have the spectacle of a gigantic nature moved by passions;
yet both are controlled by reason, not so much by the reflective
understanding, as by an innate sense of what is great and
noble. Alexander was Aristotle's pupil. In his best moments,
in his fairest and most solid actions, the spirit of Aristotle's teaching
ruled him and attended him, as Achilles was ruled and attended
by Pallas. Again, in generosity, Alexander recalls Achilles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
His treatment of the wife and daughters of Darius reminds us of
the reception of Priam by the son of Peleus. Grote, indeed,
points out that good policy prompted him to spare the life of
the Persian queen. That may be true; but it would have been
quite consistent with the Greek standard of honor to treat her
with indignity while he preserved her life. This Alexander refrained
from doing. His entertainment of Stateira was not unworthy
of a queen; and if he did not exhibit the refined courtesy
of the Black Prince, he came as near to this ideal of modern
chivalry as a Greek could do. In the last place, Alexander, like
Achilles, was always young. Like Achilles, he died young, and
exists for us as an immortal youth. This youthfulness is one of
the peculiar attributes of a Greek hero, one of the distinguishing
features of Greek sculpture&mdash;in a word, the special mark of the
Greek race. "O Solon! Solon!" said the priest of Egypt, "you
Greeks are always boys!" Achilles and Alexander, as Hegel has
most eloquently demonstrated, are forever adolescent. Yet, after
all is said, Alexander fell far below his prototype in beauty and
sublimity. He was nothing more than a heroic man. Achilles
was the creature of a poet's brain, of a nation's mythology. The
one was the ideal in its freshness and its freedom. The other
was the real, dragged in the mire of the world, and enthralled by
the necessities of human life.</p>

<p>It is very difficult, by any process of criticism, to define the impression
of greatness and of glory which the character of Achilles
leaves upon the mind. There is in him a kind of magnetic fascination,
something incommensurable and indescribable, a quality
like that which Goethe defined as d&aelig;monic. They are not always
the most noble or the most admirable natures which exert
this influence over their fellow-creatures. The Emperor Napoleon
and our own Byron had each, perhaps, a portion of this Achilleian
personality. Men of their stamp sway the soul by their pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>tige,
by their personal beauty and grandeur, by the concentrated
intensity of their character, and by the fatality which seems to
follow them. To Achilles, to Alexander, to Napoleon, we cannot
apply the rules of our morality. It is, therefore, impossible for
us, who must aim first at being good citizens, careful in our generation,
and subordinate to the laws of society around us, to admire
them without a reservation. Yet, after all is said, a great
and terrible glory does rest upon their heads; and though our
sentiments of propriety may be offended by some of their actions,
our sense of what is awful and sublime is satisfied by the
contemplation of them. No one should delude us into thinking
that true culture does not come from the impassioned study of
everything, however eccentric and at variance with our own mode
of life, that is truly great. Greatness, of whatever species it may
be, is always elevating and spirit-stirring. When we listen to
the Eroica Symphony, and remember that that master-work of
music was produced by the genius of Beethoven, brooding over
the thoughts of Achilles in the <i>Iliad</i>, and of Napoleon upon the
battle-fields of Lombardy, we may feel how abyss cries to abyss,
and how all forms of human majesty meet and sustain each other.</p>

<p class="right">Prelude to <i>Tristram and Iseult</i>, lines 91-94.</p>


<p>Helen of Troy is one of those ideal creatures of the fancy
over which time, space, and circumstance, and moral probability
exert no sway. It would be impossible to conceive of her except
as inviolably beautiful and young, in spite of all her wanderings
and all she suffered at the hands of Aphrodite and of men. She
moves through Greek heroic legend as the desired of all men and
the possessed of many. Theseus bore her away while yet a girl
from Sparta. Her brethren, Castor and Polydeukes, recovered
her from Athens by force, and gave to her &AElig;thra, the mother of
Theseus, for bondwoman. Then all the youths of Hellas wooed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
her in the young world's prime. She was at last assigned in wedlock
to Menelaus, by whom she conceived her only earthly child,
Hermione. Paris, by aid of Aphrodite, won her love and fled
with her to Egypt and to Troy. In Troy she abode more than
twenty years, and was the mate of Deiphobus after the death of
Paris. When the strife raised for her sake was ended, Menelaus
restored her with honor to his home in Laced&aelig;mon. There she
received Telemachus and saw her daughter mated to Neoptolemus.
But even after death she rested not from the service of
love. The great Achilles, who in life had loved her by hearsay,
but had never seen her, clasped her among the shades upon the
island Leuk&eacute;, and begat Euphorion. Through all these adventures
Helen maintains an ideal freshness, a mysterious virginity
of soul. She is not touched by the passion she inspires, or by
the wreck of empires ruined in her cause. Fate deflours her
not, nor do years impair the magic of her charm. Like beauty,
she belongs alike to all and none. She is not judged as wives or
mothers are, though she is both; to her belong soul-wounding
blossoms of inexorable love, as well as pain-healing poppy-heads
of oblivion; all eyes are blinded by the adorable, incomparable
grace which Aphrodite sheds around her form.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Whether Helen was the slave or the beloved of Aphrodite, or
whether, as Herodotus hinted, she was herself a kind of Aphrodite,
we are hardly told. At one time she appears the willing
servant of the goddess; at another she groans beneath her bondage.
But always and on all occasions she owes everything to the
Cyprian queen. Her very body-gear preserved the powerful charm
with which she was invested at her birth. When the Phocians
robbed the Delphian treasure-house, the wife of one of their captains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>took and wore Helen's necklace, whereupon she doted on a
young Epirot soldier and eloped with him.</p>

<p>Whose daughter was Helen? The oldest legend calls her the
child of Leda and of Zeus. We have all read the tale of the
Swan who was her father amid the rushes of Eurotas&mdash;the tale
which Leonardo and Buonarroti and Correggio thought worthy
of their loveliest illustration. Another story gives her for the
offspring of Oceanus and Tethys, as though, in fact, she were an
Aphrodite risen from the waves. In yet a third, Zeus is her sire
and Nemesis her mother; and thus the lesson of the tale of Troy
was allegorized in Helen's pedigree. She is always god-begotten
and divinely fair. Was it possible that anything so exquisite
should have endured rough ravishment and borne the travail of
the siege of Troy? This doubt possessed the later poets of the
legendary age. They spun a myth according to which Helen
reached the shore of Egypt on the ship of Paris; but Paris had
to leave her there in cedar-scented chambers by the stream of
Nile, when he went forth to plough the foam, uncomforted save
by her phantom. And for a phantom the Greeks strove with the
Trojans on the windy plains of Ilium. For a phantom's sake
brave Hector died, and the leonine swiftness of Achilles was
tamed, and Zeus bewailed Sarpedon, and Priam's towers were levelled
with the ground. Helen, meanwhile&mdash;the beautiful, the inviolable&mdash;sat
all day long among the palm-groves, twining lotus-flowers
for her hair, and learning how to weave rare Eastern patterns
in the loom. This legend hides a delicate satire upon human
strife. For what do men disquiet themselves in warfare to
the death, and tossing on sea-waves? Even for a phantom&mdash;for
the shadow of their desire, the which remains secluded in some
unapproachable, far, sacred land. A wide application may thus
be given to Augustine's passionate outcry: "Quo vobis adhuc et
adhuc ambulare vias difficiles et laboriosas? Non est requies ubi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
qu&aelig;ritis eam. Qu&aelig;rite quod qu&aelig;ritis; sed ibi non est ubi qu&aelig;ritis.
Beatam vitam qu&aelig;ritis in regione mortis; non est illic."
Those who spake ill of Helen suffered. Stesichorus had ventured
in the &#7992;&#955;&#8055;&#959;&#965; &#928;&#8051;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#962;  to lay upon her shoulders all the guilt and suffering
of Hellas and of Troy. Whereupon he was smitten with
blindness, nor could he recover his sight till he had written the
palinode which begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;' &#7956;&#964;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#959;&#8016;&#948;' &#7956;&#946;&#945;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#957;&#945;&#965;&#963;&#8054;&#957; &#949;&#8016;&#963;&#8051;&#955;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#962;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#959;&#8016;&#948;' &#7989;&#954;&#949;&#959; &#960;&#8051;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#956;&#945; &#932;&#961;&#959;&#8055;&#945;&#962;.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even Homer, as Plato hints, knew not that blindness had fallen
on him for like reason. To assail Helen with reproach was not
less dangerous than to touch the Ark of the Covenant, for with
the Greeks beauty was a holy thing. How perfectly beautiful
she was we know from the legend of the cups modelled upon her
breasts suspended in the shrine of Aphrodite. When Troy was
taken, and the hungry soldiers of Odysseus roamed through the
burning palaces of Priam and his sons, their swords fell beneath
the vision of her loveliness. She had wrought all the ruin, yet
Menelaus could not touch her, when she sailed forth, swan-like,
fluttering white raiment, with the imperturbable sweet smile of a
goddess on her lips. It remained for a Roman poet to describe
her vile and shrinking:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Illa sibi infestos eversa ob Pergama Teucros,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et p&#339;nas Dana&ucirc;m et deserti conjugis iras<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>The morality of these lines belongs to a later age of reflection
upon Greek romance. In Homer there are no such epigrams.
Between the Helen of the <i>Iliad</i>, reverenced by the elders in the
Sc&aelig;an gate, and the Helen of the <i>Odyssey</i>, queen-like among her
Spartan maidens, there has passed no agony of fear. The shame
which she has truly felt has been tempered to a silent sorrow,
and she has poured her grief forth beside Andromache over the
corpse of Hector.</p>

<p>If we would fain see the ideal beauty of the early Greek imagination
in a form of flesh-and-blood reality, we must follow
Helen through the Homeric poems. She first appears when Iris
summons her to watch the duel of Paris and Menelaus. Husband
and lover are to fight beneath the walls of Troy. She, meanwhile,
is weaving a purple peplus with the deeds of war done and
the woes endured for her sake far and wide:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She in a moment round her shoulders flings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robe of white lawn, and from the threshold springs,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Also two women in her train she brings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The large-eyed Clymen&eacute; and &AElig;thra fair,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>English eyes know well how Helen looked as she left her chamber
and hastened to the gate; for has not Leighton painted her
with just so much of far-off sorrow in her gaze as may become a
daughter of the gods? In the gate sat Priam and his elders, and
as they looked at Helen no angry curses rose to their lips, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>reverential admiration filled them, together with an awful sense
of the dread fate attending her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These, seeing Helen at the tower arrive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One to another wing&egrave;d words addressed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well may the Trojans and Ach&aelig;ans strive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a long time bear sorrow and unrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such a woman, in her cause and quest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who like immortal goddesses in face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeareth; yet 'twere even thus far best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ships to send her back to her own place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest a long curse she leave to us and all our race."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is thus simply, and by no mythological suggestion of Aphrodite's
influence, that Homer describes the spirit of beauty which
protected Helen among the people she had brought to sore
straits.</p>

<p>Priam accosts her tenderly; not hers the blame that the gods
scourge him in his old age with war. Then he bids her sit beside
him and name the Greek heroes as they march beneath. She
obeys, and points out Agamemnon, Odysseus, and Ajax, describing
each, as she knew them of old. But for her twin brothers
she looks in vain; and the thought of them touches her with the
sorrow of her isolation and her shame. In the same book, after
Paris has been withdrawn, not without dishonor, from the duel
by Aphrodite, Helen is summoned by her liege-mistress to his
bed. Helen was standing on the walls, and the goddess, disguised
as an old spinning-woman, took her by the skirt, bidding her hie
back to her lover, whom she would find in his bedchamber, not
as one arrayed for war, but as a fair youth resting haply from the
dance. Homer gives no hint that Aphrodite is here the personified
wish of Helen's own heart going forth to Paris. On the
contrary, the Cyprian queen appears in the interests of the Phrygian
youth, whom she would fain see comforted. Under her disguise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Helen recognized Aphrodite, the terrible queen, whose bondwoman
she was forced to be. For a moment she struggled against
her fate. "Art thou come again," she cried, "to bear me to some
son of earth beloved of thee, that I may serve his pleasure to my
own shame? Nay, rather, put off divinity and be thyself his odalisque."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"With <i>him</i> remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Him</i> sit with, and from heaven thy feet refrain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep, till his wife he make thee, or fond slave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I go to him no more, to win new stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scorn of Trojan women again outbrave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whelmed even now with grief's illimitable wave."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But go she must. Aphrodite is a hard taskmistress, and the
mysterious bond of beauty which chains Helen to her cannot be
broken. It is in vain, too, that Helen taunts Paris: he reminds
her of the first fruition of their love in the island Crana&euml;; and at
the last she has to lay her down at his side, not uncomplying, conquered,
as it were, by the reflex of the passion she herself excites.
It is in the chamber of Paris that Hector finds her. She has vainly
striven to send Paris forth to battle; and the sense of her own
degradation, condemned to love a man love-worthy only for the
beauty of his limbs, overcomes her when she sees the noble Hector
clothed in panoply for war. Her passionate outbreak of self-pity
and self-reproach is, perhaps, the strongest indication given
in the <i>Iliad</i> of a moral estimate of Helen's crime. The most consummate
art is shown by the poet in thus quickening the conscience
of Helen by contact with the nobility of Hector. Like
Guinevere, she for a moment seems to say: "Thou art the highest,
and most human too!" casting from her as worthless the allurements
of the baser love for whose sake she had left her home.
In like manner, it was not without the most exquisite artistic intention
that Homer made the parting scene between Andromache<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and Hector follow immediately upon this meeting. For Andromache
in the future there remained only sorrow and servitude.
Helen was destined to be tossed from man to man, always desirable
and always delicate, like the sea-foam that floats upon the
crests of waves. But there is no woman who, reading the <i>Iliad</i>,
would not choose to weep with Andromache in Hector's arms,
rather than to smile like Helen in the laps of lovers for whom she
little cared. Helen and Andromache meet together before Hector's
corpse, and it is here that we learn to love best what is
womanly in Leda's daughter. The mother and the wife have bewailed
him in high thrilling threni. Then Helen advances to the
bier and cries:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hector, of brethren dearest to my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I in sooth am Alexander's bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who brought me hither: would I first had died!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'tis the twentieth year of doom deferred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Troyward from my fatherland I hied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never in those years mine ear hath heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thy most gracious lips one sharp accusing word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, if by other I haply were reviled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brother, or sister fair, or brother's bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or mother (for the king was alway mild),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou with kind words the same hast pacified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gentle words, and mien like summer-tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore I mourn for thee and mine own ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grieving at heart: for in Troy town so wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friend have I none, nor harborer of good-will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from my touch all shrink with deadly shuddering chill.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would have been impossible to enhance more worthily than
thus the spirit of courtesy and knightly kindness which was in
Hector&mdash;qualities, in truth, which, together with his loyalty to
Andromache, endeared the champion of the Trojans to chivalry,
and placed Hector upon the list of worthies beside King Arthur
and Godfrey of Bouillon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>The character of Helen loses much of its charm and becomes
more conventional in the <i>Odyssey</i>. It is difficult to believe that
the poet who put into her lips the last lines of that threnos could
have ventured to display the same woman calm and innocent and
queen-like in the home of Menelaus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While in his mind he sat revolving this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from her fragrant bower came Helen fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright as the golden-spindled Artemis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adraste set the couch; Alcippe there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fine-spun carpet spread; and Phylo bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silver basket which Alcandra gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consort of Polybus, who dwelt whilere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Thebes of Egypt, whose great houses save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wealth in their walls, large store, and pomp of treasure brave.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Helen shows her prudence and insight by at once declaring the
stranger guest to be Telemachus; busy with housewifely kindness,
she prepares for him a comfortable couch at night; nor does
she shrink from telling again the tales of Troy, and the craft
which helped Odysseus in the Wooden Horse. The blame of her
elopement with Paris she throws on Aphrodite, who had carried
her across the sea:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Leaving my child an orphan far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And couch, and husband who had known no peer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First in all grace of soul and beauty shining clear.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such words, no doubt, fell with honey-sweet flattery from the
lips of Helen on the ears of Menelaus. Yet how could he forget
the grief of his bereavement, the taunts of Achilles and Thersites,
and the ten years' toil at Troy endured for her? Perhaps he remembered
the promise of Proteus, who had said, "Thee will the
immortals send to the Elysian plains and farthest verge of earth;
where dwells yellow-haired Rhadamanthus, and where the ways
of life are easiest for men; snow falls not there, nor storm, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
any rain, but Ocean ever breathes forth delicate zephyr breezes to
gladden men; since thou hast Helen for thine own, and art the
son-in-law of Zeus." Such future was full recompense for sorrow
in the past. Besides, Helen, as Homer tells, had charms to soothe
the soul and drown the memory of the saddest things. Even at
this time, when thought is troublesome, she mixes Egyptian nepenth&eacute;
with the wine&mdash;nepenth&eacute; "which, whoso drinks thereof
when it is mingled in the bowl, begets for him oblivion of all woe;
through a whole day he drops no tear adown his cheek, not even
should his sire or mother die, nay, should they slay his brother or
dear son before his face, and he behold it with his eyes. Such
virtuous juices had the child of Zeus, of potent charm, which Polydamna,
wife of Thon, gave to her, the Egyptian woman, where
earth yields many medicines, some of weal and some of bane."
This nepenth&eacute; was the secret of Helen's power. In the fifteenth
book of the <i>Odyssey</i> we have yet another glimpse of Helen in the
palace of Menelaus. She interprets an omen in favor of Odysseus,
which had puzzled Menelaus, and gives to Telemachus a costly
mantle, star-bright, the weft of her own loom, produced from
the very bottom of the chest in which she stored her treasures.
The only shadow cast upon Helen in the <i>Odyssey</i> is to be found
lurking in the ominous name of Megapenthes, Menelaus's son by a
slave-woman, who was destined after his sire's death to expel her
from fair Laced&aelig;mon. We may remember that it was on the
occasion of the spousal of this son to Alector's daughter, and of
the sending of Hermione to be the bride of Neoptolemus, that
Telemachus first appeared before the eyes of Helen.</p>

<p>The charm of Helen in the Homeric poems is due in a great
measure to the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of the poet's art. The situations in which
she appears are never strained, nor is the ethical feeling, though
indicated, suffered to disturb the calm influence of her beauty.
This is not the case with &AElig;schylus. Already, as before hinted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Stesichorus in his lyric interludes had ventured to assail the character
of Helen, applying to her conduct the moral standard which
Homer kept carefully out of sight. &AElig;schylus goes further. His
object was to use Hellenic romance as the subject-matter for a
series of dramatic studies which should set forth his conception
of the divine government of the world. A genius for tragedy
which has never been surpassed was subordinated by him to a
sublime philosophy of human life. It was no longer possible for
Helen to escape judgment. Her very name supplied the keynote
of reproach. Rightly was she called Helen&mdash;&#7953;&#955;&#8051;&#957;&#945;&#965;&#962;, &#7957;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#962;,
&#7953;&#955;&#8051;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#962;&mdash;"a hell of ships, hell of men, hell of cities," she sailed
forth to Troy, and the heedless Trojans sang marriage-songs in
her praise, which soon were turned to songs of mourning for her
sake. She, whom they welcomed as "a spirit of unruffled calm,
a gentle ornament of wealth, a darter of soft glances, a soul-wounding
love-blossom," was found to be no less a source of mischief
than is a young lion nurtured in the palace for the ruin of
its heirs. Soon had the Trojans reason to revile her as a "Fury
bringing woe on wives." The choruses of the <i>Agamemnon</i> are
weighted with the burden of her sin. "&#7992;&#8060; &#7984;&#8060; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8049;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7961;&#955;&#8051;&#957;&#945;,"
it breaks forth: "thine is the blood-guilt of those many, many
souls slain beneath Troy walls!" She is incarnate At&eacute;, the soul-seducing,
crime-engendering, woe-begetting curse of two great
nations. Zeus, through her sin, wrought ruin for the house of
Priam, wanton in its wealth. In the dark came blinded Paris
and stole her forth, and she went lightly through her husband's
doors, and dared a hateful deed. Menelaus, meanwhile, gazed on
the desecrated marriage-bed, and seemed to see her floating through
his halls; and the sight of beauteous statues grew distasteful to
his eyes, and he yearned for her across the sea in dreams. Naught
was left, when morning came, but vain forth-stretchings of eager
hands after the shapes that follow on the paths of sleep. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
war awoke, and Ares, who barters the bodies of men for gold,
kept sending home to Hellas from Troy a little white dust stored
in brazen urns. It is thus that &AElig;schylus places in the foreground,
not the witchery of Helen and the charms of Aphrodite, but her
lightness and her sin, the woe it wrought for her husband, and the
heavy griefs that through her fell on Troy and Hellas. It would
be impossible to moralize the consequences of the woman's crime
with greater sternness.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have no means of stating how Sophocles
dealt with the romance of Helen. Judging by analogy, however,
we may feel sure that in this, as in other instances, he advanced
beyond the ethical standpoint of &AElig;schylus, by treating the child
of Leda, no longer as an incarnation of d&aelig;monic At&eacute;, but as a
woman whose character deserved the most profound analysis.
Euripides, as usual, went a step further. The bloom of unconscious
innocence had been brushed by &AElig;schylus from the flower
of Greek romance. It was impossible for any subsequent dramatist
to avoid in some way moralizing the character of Helen. The
way selected by Euripides was to bring her down to the level of
common life. The scene in the <i>Troades</i> in which Helen stands
up to plead for her life against Hecuba before the angry Menelaus
is one of the most complete instances of the Euripidean
sophistry. The tragic circumstances of Troy in ruins and of injured
husband face to face with guilty wife are all forgotten,
while Helen develops a very clever defence of her conduct in a
long rhetorical oration. The theatre is turned into a law-court,
and forensic eloquence is substituted for dramatic poetry. Hecuba
replies with an elaborate description of the lewdness, vanity,
and guile of Helen, which we may take to be a fair statement of
the poet's own conception of her character, since in the <i>Orestes</i>
he puts similar charges into the mouth of Agamemnon's daughter.
There is no doubt that Hecuba has the best of the argument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
She paints the beauty of her son Paris and the barbaric pomp
which he displayed at Sparta. Then turning to Helen&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Sententious epigrams like this, by which the myths were philosophized
to suit the occasions of daily life, exactly suited the
temper of the Athenian audience in the age of Euripides. But
Hecuba proceeds: "You played your husband off against your
lover, and your lover against your husband, hoping always to keep
the one or the other by your artifice; and when Troy fell, no one
found you tying the halter or sharpening the knife against your
own throat, as any decent woman in your position would have
done." At the end of her speech she seems to have convinced
Menelaus, who orders the attendants to carry off Helen to the
ships, in order that she may be taken to Argos and killed there.
Hecuba begs him not to embark her on the same boat with himself.
"Why?" he asks. "Is she heavier than she used to be?"
The answer is significant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;' &#7952;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#962; &#8005;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8150;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Once a lover, always a lover." And so it turns out; for, at the
opening of the <i>Orestes</i>, Helen arrives in comfort at the side of
Menelaus. He now is afraid lest she should be seized and stoned
by the Argives, whose children had been slain for her sake in
Troy. Nor is the fear vain. Orestes and Pylades lay hold of
her, and already the knife is at her throat, when Ph&#339;bus descends
and declares that Helen has been caught up to heaven to
reign with her brothers Castor and Polydeukes. A more unethical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>termination to her adventures can hardly be imagined; for
Euripides, following hitherto upon the lines of the Homeric story,
has been at great pains to analyze her legend into a common tale
of adultery and female fascination. He now suddenly shifts his
ground and deifies the woman he had sedulously vilified before.
His true feeling about Helen is expressed in the lines spoken by
Electra to Clytemnestra (<i>Electra</i>, 1062):</p>

<p>"You and your sister are a proper pair, and your beauty has
brought you the credit you deserve: both are light women and
unworthy of Castor; for Helen allowed herself to be ravished
and undone, while you killed the best man in Greece." Further
illustrations of the Euripidean conception of Helen as a worthless
woman, who had the art to reconquer a weak husband's affection,
might be drawn from the tirade of Peleus against Menelaus in
the <i>Andromache</i> (590, etc.).<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>This Euripidean reading of the character of Helen was natural
to a sceptical and sophistical age, when the dimly moralized myths
of ancient Hellas had become the raw material for a poet's casuistry.
Yet, in the heart of the Greek people, Homer had still a
deeper, firmer place than even Euripides; and the thought of
Helen, ever beautiful and ever young, survived the rude analysis
of the Athenian drama. Her romance recovered from the prosaic
rationalism to which it had been subjected&mdash;thanks, no doubt, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>the many sculptors and painters who immortalized her beauty,
without suggesting the woes that she had brought upon the
world. Those very woes, perhaps, may have added pathos to her
charm; for had not she too suffered in the strife of men? How
the artists dealt with the myth of Helen we only know by scattered
hints and fragments. One bass-relief, engraved by Millingen,
reveals her standing calm beneath the sword of Menelaus. That
sword is lifted, but it will not fall. Beauty, breathed around her
like a spell, creates a magic atmosphere through which no steel
can pierce. In another bass-relief, from the Campana Museum,
she is entering Sparta on a chariot, side by side with Menelaus,
not like a captive, but with head erect and haughty mien, and
proud hand placed upon the horse's reins. Philostratus, in his
<i>Lives of the Sophists</i>, describes an exceedingly beautiful young
philosopher, whose mother bore a close resemblance to the picture
of Helen by Eumelus. If the lineaments of the mother were repeated
in the youth, the eyes of Helen in her picture must have
been large and voluptuous, her hair curled in clusters, and her
teeth of dazzling whiteness. It is probable that the later artists,
in their illustrations of the romance of Helen, used the poems of
Lesches and Arctinus, now lost, but of which the <i>Posthomerica</i> of
Quintus Smyrn&aelig;us preserve to us a feeble reflection. This poet
of the fourth century after Christ does all in his power to rehabilitate
the character of Helen by laying the fault of her crime
on Paris, and by describing at length the charm which Venus shed
around her sacred person. It was only by thus insisting upon
the d&aelig;monic influence which controlled the fate of Helen that
the conclusions reached by the rationalizing process of the dramatists
could be avoided. The Cyclic poems thus preserved the
heroic character of Helen and her husband at the expense of
Aphrodite, while Euripides had said plainly: "What you call
Aphrodite is your own lust." Menelaus, in the <i>Posthomerica</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
finds Helen hidden in the palace of Deiphobus; astonishment
takes possession of his soul before the shining of her beauty, so
that he stands immovable, like a dead tree, which neither north
nor south wind shakes. When the Greek heroes leave Troy town,
Agamemnon leads Cassandra captive, Neoptolemus is followed by
Andromache, and Hecuba weeps torrents of tears in the strong
grasp of Odysseus. A crowd of Trojan women fill the air with
shrill laments, tearing their tresses and strewing dust upon their
heads. Meanwhile, Helen is delayed by no desire to wail or
weep; but a comely shame sits on her black eyes and glowing
cheeks. Her heart leaps, and her whole form is as lovely as Aphrodite
was when the gods discovered her with Ares in the net of
Heph&aelig;stus. Down to the ships she comes with Menelaus hand
in hand; and the people, "gazing on the glory and the winning
grace of the faultless woman, were astonished; nor could they
dare by whispers or aloud to humble her with insults; but gladly
they saw in her a goddess, for she seemed to all what each desired."
This is the apotheosis of Helen; and this reading of her
romance is far more true to the general current of Greek feeling
than that suggested by Euripides. Theocritus, in his exquisite
marriage-song of Helen, has not a word to say by hint or innuendo
that she will bring a curse upon her husband. Like dawn is the
beauty of her face; like the moon in the heaven of night, or the
spring when winter is ended, or like a cypress in the meadow, so
is Helen among Spartan maids. When Apollonius of Tyana, the
most famous <i>medium</i> of antiquity, evoked the spirit of Achilles
by the pillar on his barrow in the Troad, the great ghost consented
to answer five questions. One of these concerned Helen: Did
she really go to Troy? Achilles indignantly repudiated the notion.
She remained in Egypt; and this the heroes of Achaia
soon knew well; "but we fought for fame and Priam's wealth."</p>

<p>It is curious at the point of transition in the Roman world from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
paganism to Christianity to find the name of Helen prominent.
Helena, the mother of Constantine, was famous with the early
Church as a pilgrim to Jerusalem, where she discovered the true
cross, and destroyed the temple of Venus. For one Helen, East
and West had warred together on the plains of Troy. Following
the steps of another Helen, West and East now disputed the possession
of the Holy Sepulchre. Such historical parallels are, however,
little better than puns. It is far more to the purpose to
notice how the romance of Helen of Troy, after lying dormant
during the Middle Ages, shone forth again in the pregnant myth
of Faustus. The final achievement of Faust's magic was to evoke
Helen from the dead and hold her as his paramour. To the
beauty of Greek art the medi&aelig;val spirit stretched forth with
yearning and begot the modern world. Marlowe, than whom no
poet of the North throbbed more mightily with the passion of
the Renaissance, makes his Faust exclaim:</p>

<span class="i0">Her lips suck forth my soul: see where it flies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here will I dwell, for heaven is in these lips,<br /></span>

<p>Marlowe, as was natural, contented himself with an external
handling of the Faust legend. Goethe allegorized the whole, and
turned the episode of Helen into a parable of modern poetry.
When Lynkeus, the warder, is reprimanded for not having duly
asked Helen into the feudal castle, he defends himself thus;</p>

<p>The new light that rose upon the Middle Ages came not from
the East, but from the South, no longer from Galilee, but from
Greece.</p>

<p>Thus, after living her long life in Hellas as the ideal of beauty,
unqualified by moral attributes, Helen passed into modern mythology
as the ideal of the beauty of the pagan world. True to her
old character, she arrives to us across the waters of oblivion with
the cestus of the goddess round her waist, and the divine smile
upon her lips. Age has not impaired her charm, nor has she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>learned the lesson of the Fall. Ever virginal and ever fair, she
is still the slave of Aphrodite. In Helen we welcome the indestructible
Hellenic spirit.</p>

<p>Penelope is the exact opposite to Helen. The central point
in her character is intense love of her home, an almost cat-like attachment
to the house where she first enjoyed her husband's love
and which is still full of all the things that make her life worth
having. Therefore, when at last she thinks that she will have
to yield to the suitors and leave it, these words are always on her
lips:</p>

<p>We can scarcely think of Penelope except in the palace of Ithaca,
so firmly has this home-loving instinct been embedded in her by
her maker. Were it not that the passion for her home is controlled
and determined by a higher and more sacred feeling, this
Haush&auml;lterischness of Penelope would be prosaic. Not only,
however, has Homer made it evident in the <i>Odyssey</i> that the love
of Ithaca is subordinate in her soul to the love of Odysseus, but
a beautiful Greek legend teaches how in girlhood she sacrificed
the dearest ties that can bind a woman to her love for the hero
who had wooed and won her. Pausanias says that when Odysseus
was carrying her upon his chariot forth to his own land, her
father, Icarius, followed in their path and besought her to stay
with him. The young man was ready busked for the long journey.
The old man pointed to the hearth she had known from
childhood. Penelope between them answered not a word, but
covered her face with her veil. This action Odysseus interpreted
rightly, and led his bride away, willing to go where he would go,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>yet unwilling to abandon what she dearly loved. No second
Odysseus could cross the woman's path. Among the suitors
there was not one like him. Therefore she clung to her house-tree
in Ithaca, the olive around which Odysseus had built the
nuptial chamber; and none, till he appeared, by force or guile
might win her thence. It is precisely this tenacity in the character
of Penelope which distinguishes her from Helen, the daughter
of adventure and the child of change, to whom migration was no
less natural than to the swan that gave her life. Another characteristic
of Penelope is her prudence. Having to deal with the
uproarious suitors camped in her son's halls, she deceives them
with fair words, and promises to choose a husband from their
number when she has woven a winding-sheet for Laertes. Three
years pass, and the work is still not finished. At last a maiden
tells the suitors that every night Penelope undoes by lamplight
what she had woven in the daytime. This ruse of the defenceless
woman has passed into a proverb; and has become so familiar
that we forget, perhaps, how true a parable it is of those who, in
their weakness, do and undo daily what they would fain never do
at all, trifling and procrastinating with tyrannous passions which
they are unable to expel from the palace of their souls. The prudence
of Penelope sometimes assumes a form which reminds us
of the heroines of Hebrew story; as when, for example, she spoils
the suitors of rich gifts by subtle promises and engagements carefully
guarded. Odysseus, seated in disguise near the hall-door,
watches her success and secretly approves. The same quality of
mind makes her cautious in the reception of the husband she has
waited for in widowhood through twenty years. The dog Argus
has no doubt. He sees his master through the beggar's rags, and
dies of joy. The handmaid Eurycleia is convinced as soon as
she has touched the wound upon the hero's foot and felt the well-remembered
scar. Not so Penelope. Though the great bow has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
been bent and the suitors have been slain, and though Eurycleia
comes to tell her the whole truth, the queen has yet the heart to
seat herself opposite Odysseus by the fire, and to prove him with
cunningly devised tests. There is something provocative of anger
against Penelope in this cross-questioning. But our anger is dissolved
in tears, when at last, feeling sure that her husband and
none other is there verily before her eyes, she flings her arms
around him in that long and close embrace. Homer even in this
supreme moment has sustained her character by a trait which
however delicate, can hardly escape notice. Her lord is weary
and would fain seek the solace of his couch. But he has dropped
a hint that still more labors are in store for him. Then Penelope
replies that his couch is ready at all times and whensoever he
may need; no hurry about that. Meanwhile, she would like to
hear the prophecy of Teiresias. Helen, the bondwoman of dame
Aphrodite, would not have waited thus upon the edge of love's
delight, long looked for with strained widow's eyes. Yet it
would be unfair to Penelope to dwell only on this prudent and
somewhat frigid aspect of her character. She is, perhaps, most
amiable when she descends among the suitors and prays Phemius
to cease from singing of the heroes who returned from Troy.
It is more than she can bear to sit weaving in the silent chamber
mid her damsels, listening to the shrill sound of the lyre and
hearing how other men have reached their homes, while on the
waves Odysseus still wanders, and none knows whether he be
alive or dead. It may be noticed that just as Helen is a mate
meet for easily persuaded Menelaus and luxurious Paris, so Penelope
matches the temper of the astute, enduring, persevering
Odysseus. As a creature of the fancy, she is far less fascinating
than Helen; and this the poet seems to have felt, for side by side
with Penelope in the <i>Odyssey</i> he has placed the attractive forms
of Circe, Calypso, and Nausicaa. The gain is double. Not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
are the hearers of the romance gladdened by the contrast of these
graceful women with the somewhat elegiac figure of Penelope,
but the character of Odysseus for constancy is greatly enhanced.
How fervent must the love of home have been in the man who
could quit Calypso, after seven years' sojourn, for the sake of a
wife grown gray with twenty widowed years! Odysseus tells
Calypso to her face that she is far fairer than his wife:</p>

<p>"As far as looks go, Penelope is nothing beside thee." But
what Odysseus leaves unsaid&mdash;the grace of the first woman who
possessed his soul&mdash;constrains him with a deeper, tenderer power
than any of Calypso's charms. Penelope, meanwhile, is pleading
that her beauty in the absence of her lord has perished:</p>

<p>These two meet at last together, he after his long wanderings,
and she having suffered the insistance of the suitors in her palace;
and this is the pathos of the <i>Odyssey</i>. The woman, in spite
of her withered youth and tearful years of widowhood, is still
expectant of her lord. He, unconquered by the pleasures cast
across his path, unterrified by all the dangers he endures, clings
in thought to the bride whom he led forth, a blushing maiden,
from her father's halls. O just, subtle, and mighty Homer!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing of Greek here more than of Hebrew, or of
Latin, or of German. It is pure humanity.</p>

<p>Calypso is not a woman, but a goddess. She feeds upon ambrosia
and nectar, while her maidens spread before Odysseus the
food of mortals. Between her and Hermes there is recognition
at first sight; for god knows god, however far apart their paths
may lie. Yet the love that Calypso bears Odysseus brings this
daughter of Atlas down to earth; and we may reckon her among
the women of Homer. How mysterious, as the Greek genius
apprehended mystery, is her cavern, hidden far away in the isle
Ogygia, with the grove of forest-trees before it and the thick vine
flourishing around its mouth. Meadows of snow-flake and close-flowering
selinus gird it round; and on the branches brood all
kinds of birds. It is an island such as the Italian painters bring
before us in their rarest moments of artistic divination, where the
blue-green of the twilight mingles with the green-blue sea and
the overarching verdure of deep empurpled forest-shade. Under
those trees, gazing across the ocean, in the still light of the evening-star,
Odysseus wept for his far-distant home. Then, heavy
at heart, he gathered up his raiment, and climbed into Calypso's
bed at night:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>To him the message of Hermes recalling him to labor on the
waves was joy; but to the nymph herself it brought mere bitterness:
"Hard are ye, gods, and envious above all, who grudge
that goddesses should couch thus openly with mortal men, if
one should make a dear bedfellow for herself. For so the rosy-fingered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>morning chose Orion, till ye gods that lead an easy life
grew jealous, and in Ogygia him the golden-throned maid Artemis
slew with her kind arrows." This wail of the immortal
nymph Calypso for her roving spouse of seven short years has
a strange pathos in it. It seems to pass across the sea like a sigh
of winds awakened, none knows how, in summer midnight, that
swells and dies far off upon moon-silvered waves. The clear human
activity of Odysseus cuts the everlasting calm of Calypso
like a knife, shredding the veil that hides her from the eyes of
mortals. Then he fares onward to resume the toils of real existence
in a land whereof she nothing knows. There is a fragment
of his last speech to Penelope, which sounds like an echo of Calypso's
lamentation. "Death," he says, "shall some day rise for
me, tranquil from the tranquil deep, and I shall die in delicate
old age." We seem to feel that in his last trance Odysseus
might have heard the far-off divine sweet voice of Calypso calling
him and have hastened to her cry.</p>

<p>Circe is by no means so mysterious as Calypso. Yet she belongs
to one of the most interesting families in Greek romance.
Her mother was Perse, daughter of Oceanus; her father was
Helios; she is own sister, therefore, to the Colchian &AElig;etes, and
aunt of the redoubtable Medea. She lives in the isle of &AElig;&aelig;a,
not, like Calypso, deep embowered in groves, but in a fair open
valley sweeping downward to the sea, whence her hearth-smoke
may be clearly descried. Nor is her home an ivy-curtained cavern
of the rocks, but a house well built of polished stone, protected
from the sea-winds by oak-woods. Here she dwells in
grand style, with nymphs of the streams and forests to attend
upon her, and herds of wild beasts, human-hearted, roaming
through her park. Odysseus always speaks of her with respect
as &#960;&#8057;&#964;&#957;&#953;&#945; &#922;&#8055;&#961;&#954;&#951; ... &#948;&#8150;&#945; &#952;&#949;&#8049;&#969;&#957; ... &#922;&#8055;&#961;&#954;&#951; &#7952;&#971;&#960;&#955;&#8057;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8052; &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962;
&#945;&#8016;&#948;&#8053;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945;. Like Calypso, she has a fair shrill voice that goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
across the waters, and as her fingers ply the shuttle, she keeps
singing through the summer air. By virtue of her birthright, as
a daughter of the sun, she understands the properties of plant
and drug. Poppy and henbane and mandragora&mdash;all herbs of
subtle juice that draw soul-quelling poison from the fat earth and
the burning sun&mdash;are hers to use as she thinks fit. And the use
she makes of them is malicious; for, fairy-like and wanton, she
will have the men who visit her across the seas submit their reason
to her lure. Therefore she turns them to swine; and the
lions and wolves of the mountain she tames in like manner, so
that they fawn and curl their long tails and have no heart to
ravin any more. This is how she treats the comrades of Odysseus:
"She drew them in and set them on benches and on chairs,
and put before them cheese and meat and yellow honey, mixing
therewith Pramnian wine; but with the food she mingled baleful
drugs, to make them quite forget their fatherland. But when
she had given them thereof and they had drunk, straightway she
smote them with a rod and shut them up in sties. Of swine
they had the head, the voice, the form, the bristles; but their
mind stayed firm as it had been before. So they then were
penned up, weeping bitter tears; but Circe threw before them
acorns of the oak and ilex and cornel-berries, food that the
forest-ranging swine are wont to eat." What is admirable in
this description is its gravity. Circe is not made out particularly
wicked or malignant. She is acting only after her kind,
like some beautiful but baleful plant&mdash;a wreath, for instance, of
red briony-berries, whereof if children eat, they perish. Nor,
again, is there a touch of the burlesque in the narration. Therefore,
in the charming picture which Rivi&egrave;re has painted of Circe,
we trace a vein of modern feeling. Clasping her knees with girlish
glee, she sits upon the ground beneath a tangle of wild-vine,
and watches the clumsy hogs that tumble with half-comic, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>half-pathetic
humanity expressed in their pink eyes and grunting
snouts before her. So, too, the solemn picture by Burne Jones,
a masterpiece of coloring, adds something medi&aelig;val to the Homeric
Circe. The tall sunflowers that remind us of her father,
the cringing panthers, black and lithe, the bending figure of the
saffron-vested witch, the jars of potent juices, and the distant
glimpse of sea and shore, suggest more of malignant intention
than belongs to the &#960;&#8057;&#964;&#957;&#953;&#945; &#922;&#8055;&#961;&#954;&#951;, the &#922;&#8055;&#961;&#954;&#951; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#966;&#8049;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#962; of Homer's
tale. It was inevitable that modern art should infuse a
deeper meaning into the allegory. The world has lived long and
suffered much and grown greatly since the age of Homer. We
cannot be so <i>na&iuml;f</i> and childlike any longer. Yet the true charm
of Circe in the <i>Odyssey</i>, the spirit that distinguishes her from
Tannha&uuml;ser's Venus and Orlando's Fata Morgana and Ruggiero's
Alcina and Tancred's Armida, lies just in this, that the poet has
passed so lightly over all the dark and perilous places of his subject.
This delicacy of touch can never be regained by art. It
belonged to the conditions of the first Hellenic bloom of fancy,
to suggest without insistance and to realize without emphasis.
Impatient readers may complain of want of depth and character.
They would fain see the Circe of the <i>Odyssey</i> as strongly moralized
as the Medea of Euripides. But in Homer only what is human
attains to real intensity. The marvellous falls off and shades
away into soft air-tints and delightful dreams. Still, it requires
the interposition of the gods to save Odysseus from the charms
of the malicious maid. As Hermes came to Priam on the path
between Troy town and the Achaian ships, so now he meets the
hero:</p>

<p>A plant of moly is in his hand; and this will be the antidote
to Circe's philter. Odysseus's sword and strong will must do the
rest. When Circe has once found her match, we are astonished
at the <i>bonhomie</i> which she displays. The game is over. There
remains nothing but graceful hospitality on her part&mdash;elegant
banquets, delicious baths, soft beds, the restoration of the ship's
crew to their proper shape, and a store of useful advice for the
future. "There all the days, for a whole year, we sat feasting
and drinking honeyed wine; but when the year was full, and the
seasons had gone round, moon waning after moon, and the long
days were finished, my dear comrades called on me by name, and
spake once more of home."</p>

<p>One more female figure from the <i>Odyssey</i> remains as yet untouched;
and this is the most beautiful of all. Nausicaa has no
legendary charm; she is neither mystic goddess nor weird woman,
nor is hers the dignity of wifehood. She is simply the most
perfect maiden, the purest, freshest, lightest-hearted girl of Greek
romance. Odysseus passes straight from the solitary island of
Ogygia, where elm and poplar and cypress overshadow Calypso's
cavern, into the company of this real woman. It is like coming
from a land of dreams into a dewy garden when the sun has risen:
the waves through which he has fared upon his raft have wrought
for him, as it were, a rough reincarnation into the realities of
human life. For the sea-brine is the source of vigor; and into
the deep he has cast, together with Calypso's raiment, all memory
of her.</p>

<p>Nausicaa was asleep in her Ph&aelig;acian chamber when Athene,
mindful of Odysseus's need, came down and warned her in a
dream that she should bestir herself and wash her clothes against
her marriage-day. When the damsel woke, she went straight to
her father, Alcinous, and begged him to provide a horse and
mules. Like a prudent girl, she said nothing of her marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
but spoke of the cares of the household. Her five brothers, she
said, the two wedded and the other three in the bloom of youth,
want shining raiment for the dance, and her duty it is to see that
the clothes are always ready. Alcinous knew in his heart what
she really meant, but he answered her with no unseemly jest.
Only he promised a cart and a pair of mules; and her mother
gave her food to eat, and wine in a skin, and a golden cruse of
oil, that she and her maidens might spend a pleasant morning
by the sea-beach, and bathe and anoint themselves, when their
clothes-washing was finished.</p>

<p>A prettier picture cannot be conceived than that drawn by
Homer of Nausicaa with her handmaidens thronging together
in the cart, which jogs downward through the olive-gardens to
the sea. The princess holds the whip and drives; and when she
reaches the stream's mouth by the beach, she loosens the mules
from the shafts, and turns them out to graze in the deep meadow.
Then the clothes are washed, and the luncheon is taken from the
basket, and the game of ball begins. How the ball flew aside
and fell into the water, and how the shrill cries of the damsels
woke Odysseus from his sleep, every one remembers. The girls
are fluttered by the sight of the great naked man, rugged with
brine and bruised with shipwreck. Nausicaa alone, as becomes
a princess, stands her ground and questions him. The simple
delicacy with which this situation is treated makes the whole
episode one of the most charming in Homer. Nothing can be
prettier than the change from pity to admiration, expressed by
the damsel, when Odysseus has bathed in running water, and
rubbed himself with oil and put on goodly raiment given him
by the girls. Pallas sheds treble grace upon his form, and makes
his hair to fall in clusters like hyacinth-blossoms, so that an artist
who moulds figures of gilt silver could not shape a comelier statue.
The princess, with yesternight's dream still in her soul, wishes he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
would stay and be her husband. The girlish simplicity of Nausicaa
is all the more attractive because the Ph&aelig;acians are the
most luxurious race described by Homer. The palace in which
she dwells with her father is all of bronze and silver and gold; it
shines like the sun, and a blue line marks the brazen cornice of
the walls. Dogs of silver and gold, Heph&aelig;stus's work, which
never can grow old through length of days, protect the entrance.
Richly woven robes are cast upon the couches in the hall, and
light is shed upon the banquet-tables from blazing torches in the
hands of golden boys. Outside the palace grows the garden with
well-divided orchard-rows, where pears and figs and pomegranates
and burnished apples and olives flourish all the year long. The
seasons change not in Ph&aelig;acian land for winter or for summer.
The west wind is always blowing. Pear follows after pear, and
apple after apple, and grape-bunch after grape-bunch, in a never-ending
autumn dance. Vintage, too, is there; and there are the
trim flower-beds; and through the garden flow two fountains.
The whole pleasure-ground seems to have been laid out with geometrical
Greek taste. It is a paradise of neatness, sun-bright, clear
to take in at a glance. In this delightful palace dwells Alcinous,
a kind old man, among his sons; and much delight they take in
dance and song and games of strength. The young men, whose
beards are but just growing, leap in rhythmic movement to the
flute; the elder and more muscular run or wrestle, and much contempt
do these goodly fellows, like English lads, reserve for men
who are not athletes. Odysseus has to rebuke one of them, Euryalus,
by reminding him that faultlessly fair bodies are not always
the temples of a godlike soul. Zeus gives not all of his
good gifts to all; for some men owe grace and favor to eloquence,
others to beauty, and a man may be like to the immortals in face
and form, and yet a fool. Alcinous well describes the temper of
his people when he says: "We are not faultless boxers, nor yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
wrestlers; but with our feet we race swiftly, and none can beat
us in rowing; and we aye love the banquet, and the lyre, and
dancing, and gay raiment, and warm baths, and joys of love." It
is therefore not without propriety that Demodocus, their blind
bard, "whom the Muse loved much, and gave him good and evil&mdash;for
she reft him of his sight and gave him honeyed song"&mdash;sings
of Aphrodite tangled with Ares in the net of Heph&aelig;stus. From
this soft, luxurious, comely, pleasure-loving folk Nausicaa springs
up like a pure blossom&mdash;anemone or lily of the mountains. She
has all the sweetness of temper which distinguishes Alcinous; but
the voluptuous living of her people has not spoiled her. The
maidenly reserve which she displays in her first reception of
Odysseus, her prudent avoidance of being seen with him in the
streets of the town while he is yet a stranger, and the care she
takes that he shall suffer nothing by not coming with her to the
palace, complete the portrait of a girl who is as free from coquetry
as she is from prudishness. Perhaps she strikes our fancy with
most clearness when, after bathing and dressing, Odysseus passes
her on his way through the hall to the banquet. She leaned
against the pillar of the roof and gazed upon Odysseus, and said:
"Hail, guest, and be thou mindful of me when perchance thou art
in thine own land again, for to me the first thou dost owe the
price of life." This is the last word spoken by Nausicaa in the
<i>Odyssey</i>. She is not mentioned among the Ph&aelig;acians who took
leave of the hero the day he passed to Ithaca.</p>

<p>Before quitting the women of Homer, we must return to the
<i>Iliad</i>; for without Briseis and Andromache their company would
be incomplete. As the figures in a bass-relief are variously
wrought, some projecting like independent statues in sharp light
and shadow, while others are but half detached, and a third sort
offer mere outlined profiles scarcely embossed upon the marble
background: even so the poet has obeyed a law of relative pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>portion
in his treatment of character. The subordinate heroes,
for example, in the <i>Iliad</i> fall away from the central figure of
Achilles into more or less of slightness. This does not mean that
we can trace the least indecision in Homer's touch, or that he has
slurred his work by haste or incapacity. On the contrary, there
is no poet from whom deeper lessons in the art of subordinating
accessories to the main subject without impairing their real value
can be learned. A sculptor like Pheidias knows how to give significance
to the least indication of a form which he has placed
upon the second plane in his bass-relief. Just so Homer inspires
his minor characters with personality. To detach this personality
in each case is the task of the critic; yet his labor is no light
one; for the Homeric characters draw their life from incidents,
motives, action. To the singer's fancy they appeared, not as
products of the self-conscious imagination, but as living creatures;
and to separate them from their environment of circumstance is
almost to destroy them. This is the specific beauty of the art of
Homer. In its origin it must have been the outcome, not of reflection,
but of inspired instinct; for in the Homeric age psychological
analysis was unknown, and the very nomenclature of criticism
had yet to be invented. We can draw inexhaustible lessons
in practical wisdom from the Homeric poems; but we cannot
with impunity subject those delicate creations to the critical crucible.
They delight both intellect and senses with a many-toned
harmony of exquisitely modulated parts; but the instant we begin
to dissect and theorize, we run a risk of attributing far more
method and deliberation than was natural to a poet in the early
age of Hellas. It is almost impossible to set forth the persons of
Homer except in his own way, and in close connection with the
incidents through which they are revealed; whereas the characters
of a more self-conscious artist&mdash;the Medea, for example, or
the Ph&aelig;dra of Euripides&mdash;can be described without much repeti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>tion
of their speeches or reconstruction of the dramas in which
they play their parts.</p>

<p>Andromache offers a not inapt illustration to these remarks.
She is beautiful, as all heroic women are; and Homer tells us she
is "white-armed." We know no more about her person than
this; and her character is exhibited only in the famous parting
scene and in the two lamentations which she pours forth for her
husband. Yet who has read the <i>Iliad</i> without carrying away a
distinct conception of this, the most lovable among the women
of Homer? She owes her character far less to what she does and
what she says than to how she looks in that ideal picture painted
on our memory by Homer's verse. The affection of Hector for
his wife, no less distinguished than the passion of Achilles for his
friend, has made the Trojan prince rather than his Greek rival the
hero of modern romance. When he leaves Ilion to enter on the
long combat which ends in the death of Patroclus, the last thought
of Hector is for Andromache. He finds her, not in their home,
but on the wall, attended by her nurse, who carries in her arms his
only son:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#7961;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#951;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#8055;&#947;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#963;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8183;.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her first words, after she has wept and clasped him, are:
"Love, thy stout heart will be thy death, nor hast thou pity of thy
child or me, who soon shall be a widow. My father and my
mother and my brothers are all slain; but, Hector, thou art father
to me and mother and brother, and thou too art the husband of
my youth. Have pity, then, and stay here in the tower, lest thy
son be orphaned and thy wife a widow." The answer is worthy
of the hero. "Full well," he says, "know I that Troy will fall,
and I foresee the sorrow of my brethren and the king; but for
these I grieve not: to think of thee, a slave in Argos, unmans me
almost; yet even so I will not flinch or shirk the fight. My duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>calls, and I must away." He stretches out his mailed arms to
Astyanax, but the child is frightened by his nodding plumes. So
he lays aside his helmet, and takes the baby to his breast, and
prays for him. Andromache smiles through her tears, and down
the clanging causeway strides the prince. Poor Andromache has
nothing left to do but to return home and raise the dirge for a
husband as good as dead. When we see her again in the 22d
<i>Iliad</i>, she is weaving, and her damsels are heating a bath against
Hector's return from the fight. Then suddenly the cry of Hecuba's
anguish thrills her ears. Shuttle and thread drop from her
hands; she gathers up her skirts, and like a M&aelig;nad flies forth to
the wall. She arrives in time to see her husband's body dragged
through dust at Achilles' chariot-wheels away from Troy. She
faints, and when she wakes it is to utter the most piteous lament
in Homer&mdash;not, however, for Hector so much, or for herself, as for
Astyanax. He who was reared upon a father's knees and fed
with marrow and the fat of lambs, and, when play tired him, slept
in soft beds among nursing-women, will now roam, an orphan,
wronged and unbefriended, hunted from the company of happier
men, or fed by charity with scanty scraps. The picture of an orphan's
misery among cold friends and hard oppressors is wrought
with the pathos of exquisite simplicity. And to the same theme
Andromache returns in the <i>vocero</i> which she pours forth over the
body of Hector. "I shall be a widow and a slave, and Astyanax
will either be slaughtered by Greek soldiers or set to base service
in like bondage." Then the sight of the corpse reminds her that
the last words of her sorrow must be paid to Hector himself.
What touches her most deeply is the thought of death in battle:</p>

<p>As far as studied delineation of character goes, Briseis is still more
a silhouette than Andromache. We know her as the fair-cheeked
damsel who was fain to stay with Achilles, and who loved Patroclus
because he kept for her a soothing word. In her threnos for
Patroclus she exclaims, "How one woe after another takes me!
I saw my husband slain before our city, and my three brethren;
but you, Patroclus, then comforted me, and said I should be
Achilles' wife: you were ever gentle." This is really all we
know about her. Yet Briseis lives in our memory by virtue of
the great passions gathered round her, and the weighty actions in
which she plays her part.</p>

<p>In course of years the heroes of the Homeric romances came
to be worshipped, not exactly like gods with &#952;&#965;&#963;&#8055;&#945;&#953;, but like the
more than mortal dead with &#7952;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#8055;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;. They had their chapels
and their hearths, distinct from the temples and the altars of the
deities. These were generally raised upon the supposed spot of
their sepulture, or in places which owed them special reverence as
&#339;kists or as ancestors. In the case of &#338;dipus, the translation of
the hero to the company of gods secured for him a cultus in
Colonos. It was supposed that heroes exercised a kindly influence
over the people among whom they dwelt; haunting the
neighborhood in semi-corporeal visitations, conferring benefits
upon the folk, and exhibiting signs of anger when neglected.
Thus Philostratus remarks that Protesilaus had a fane in Thessaly,
"and many humane and favorable dealings doth he show the
men of Thessaly, yea, and angerly also if he be neglected."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
same Philostratus, whose works are a treasure-house of information
respecting the latest forms of Hellenic paganism, reports the
actual form of prayer used by Appollonius of Tyana at the tomb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>of Palamedes,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and makes the ghost of Achilles complain: "The
Thessalians for a long time have remitted my offerings; still I am
not yet minded to display my wrath against them." Achilles,
who has been evoked above his tomb in the Troad by the prayers
of Apollonius, proceeds to remark that even the Trojans revere
him more than his own people, but that he cannot restore the
town of Troy to its old prosperity. He hints, however, pretty
broadly, that if the Thessalians do not pay him more attention,
he will reduce them to the same state of misery as the Trojans.
The d&aelig;mon, it may be said in passing, vanishes, like a medi&aelig;val
ghost, at cockcrow.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>This cultus of the Homeric heroes was, of course, inseparable
from a corresponding growth of artistic associations; and here it
is not a little curious to compare our own indefinite conceptions
of the outward form of the heroic personages with the very concrete
incarnation they received from Greek sculptors and painters.
The first memorable attempt to express the heroes of Homer in
marble was upon the pediment at &AElig;gina; the first elaborate pictorial
representation was that of Polygnotus on the walls of the
<i>Lesche</i> at Delphi. A Greek <i>Lesche</i> was not unlike an Italian or
Oriental caf&eacute;, extended to suffice for the requirements of a whole
city. What has been discovered at Pompeii, in addition to the
full description of the Delphian <i>Lesche</i> by Pausanias, inclines us
to believe that the walls of these public places of resort were not
unfrequently decorated with Homeric pictures. The beautiful
frescos of Achilles among the daughters of Lycomedes, of Achilles
bathed by Thetis in the Styx, of Briseis led forth by Patroclus
into the company of the Achaian chiefs, and of Penelope questioning
the disguised Odysseus about her husband, which have
been discovered in various parts of Pompeii, sufficiently illustrate
to modern minds the style of this wall-painting. The treatise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>surnamed &#917;&#7984;&#954;&#8057;&#957;&#949;&#962; of Philostratus is an elaborate critical catalogue
of a picture-gallery of this sort; and from many indications contained
in it we learn how thoroughly the heroes of Homer had acquired
a fixed corporeal personality. In describing, for example,
a picture of the lamentation for Antilochus, he says: "These things
are Homer's paintings, but the painter's action." Then he goes
on to point out the chief persons: "You can distinguish Odysseus
at once by his severe and wideawake appearance, Menelaus by his
gentleness, Agamemnon by his inspired look; while Tydeus is indicated
by his freedom, the Telamonian Ajax by his grimness, and
the Locrian by his activity."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In another place he tells us that
Patroclus was of an olive-pale complexion (&#956;&#949;&#955;&#8055;&#967;&#955;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#962;), with black
eyes and rather thick eyebrows; his head was erect upon the
neck, like that of a man who excels in athletic exercises, his nose
straight, with wide nostrils, like an eager horse. These descriptions
occur in the <i>Heroic Dialogue</i>. They are supposed to have
been communicated by the d&aelig;mon Protesilaus to a vine-dresser
who frequented his tomb. Achilles, on the other hand, had abundant
hair, more pleasant to the sight in hue than gold, with a nose
inclining to the aquiline, angry brows, and eyes so bright and
lively that the soul seemed leaping from them in fire. Hector,
again, had a terrible look about him, and scorned to dress his hair,
and his ears were crushed, not indeed by wrestling, for barbarians
do not wrestle, but by the habit of struggling for mastery with
wild bulls.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Some of the women of Homeric story, Helen for example, and
Iphigenia, received divine honors, together with suitable artistic
personification. But women were not closely connected with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>genealogical and gentile foundations of the Greek cultus; only a
few, therefore, were thus distinguished. What has here been said
about the superstition that gave form and distinctness to the creatures
of Homeric fancy may be taken as applying in general to
the attitude assumed by ancient art. The persons of a poem or
a mythus were not subjected to critical analysis as we dissect the
characters of <i>Hamlet</i> or of <i>Faust</i>. But they were not on that
account the less vividly apprehended. They tended more and
more to become external realities&mdash;beings with a definite form
and a fixed character. In a word, through sculpture, painting,
and superstition, they underwent the same personifying process as
the saints of medi&aelig;val Italy. To what extent the Attic drama
exercised a disturbing influence and interrupted this process has
been touched upon with reference to the Euripidean Helen.</p>

<p>Hesiod, though he belongs to the first age of Greek literature,
and ranks among the earliest of Hellenic poets, marks the transition
from the heroic period to that of the despots, when ethical
inquiry began in Greece. Like Homer, Hesiod is inspired by the
Muses: alone, upon Mount Helicon, he received from them the
gift of inspiration. But the message which he communicates to
men does not concern the deeds of demigods and warriors. It
offers no material for tragedies upon the theme of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Thebes or Pelops' line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the tale of Troy divine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the contrary, Hesiod introduces us to the domestic life of
shepherds, husbandmen, and merchants. Homely precepts for
the conduct of affairs and proverbs on the utility of virtue replace
the glittering pictures of human passions and heroic strife
which the Homeric poems present. A new element is introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
into literature, the element of man reflecting on himself, questioning
the divine laws under which he is obliged to live, and determining
the balance of good and evil which the days of youth and
age bring with them in his earthly course. The individual is now
occupied with his own cares and sorrows and brief joys. Living
in the present, and perforce accommodating his imagination to
the prose of human existence, he has forgotten to dream any
longer of the past, or to reconstruct in fancy the poetic charm of
visionary heroism. It was just this difference between Homer
and Hesiod which led the aristocratic Greeks of a later age to
despise the poet of Ascra. Cleomenes, the king of Sparta, chief
of that proud military oligarchy which had controlled the destinies
of decaying Hellas, is reported by Plutarch to have said that,
while Homer was the bard of warriors and noble men, Hesiod was
the singer of the Helots. In this saying the contempt of the martial
class for the peaceable workers of the world is forcibly expressed.
It is an epigram which endears Hesiod to democratic
critics of the modern age. They can trace in its brief utterance
the contempt which has been felt in all periods&mdash;especially among
the historic Greeks, who regarded labor as ignoble, and among the
feudal races, with whom martial prowess was the main-stay of society&mdash;for
the unrecorded and unhonored earners of the bread
whereby the brilliant and the well-born live.</p>

<p>Hesiod, therefore, may be taken as the type and first expression
of a spirit in Greek literature alien from that which Homer represents.
The wrath and love of Achilles, the charm of Helen and
the constancy of Penelope, the councils of the gods, the pathos of
the death of Hector, the sorrows of King Priam and the labors of
Odysseus, are exchanged for dim and doleful ponderings upon the
destiny of man, for the shadowy mythus of Prometheus and the
vision of the ages ever growing worse as they advance in time.
All the rich and manifold arras-work of suffering and action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
which the <i>Odyssey</i> and the <i>Iliad</i> display yields to such sombre
meditation as a sad soul in the childhood of the world may pour
forth, brooding on its own wrongs and on the woes of men around.
The climax of the whole, after the justice of God has been querulously
arraigned, and the violence of princes has been appealed
against with pitiful vain iteration, is a series of practical rules for
daily conduct, and a calendar of simple ethics.</p>

<p>Very little is known about Hesiod himself; nor can the date
at which the poems ascribed to him were composed be fixed with
any certainty. Something of the same semi-mythical obscurity
which surrounds Homer envelops Hesiod. Just as Homer was
the eponymous hero of the school of epic poets in Asia Minor
and the islands, so Hesiod may be regarded as the titular president
of a rival school of poets localized near Mount Helicon in
B&#339;otia. That is to say, it is probable that the Hesiodic, like the
Homeric, poems did not emanate from their supposed author as
we read them now; but we may assume that they underwent
changes and received additions from followers who imbibed his
spirit and attempted to preserve his style. And, further, the poems
ascribed to Hesiod became, as years went by, a receptacle for
gnomic verses dear to the Greeks. Like the elegies of Theognis,
the ethical hexameters of Hesiod were, practically, an anthology
of anonymous compositions. Still Hesiod has a more distinct historic
personality than Homer. In the first place, the majority of
ancient critics regarded him as later in date and more removed
from the heroic age. Then again, he speaks in his own person,
recording many details of his life, and mentioning his father and
his brother. Homer remains forever lost, like Shakespeare, in the
creatures of his own imagination. Instead of the man Homer,
we have the Achilles and Odysseus whom he made immortal.
Hesiod tells us much about himself. A vein of personal reflection,
a certain tone of peevish melancholy, peculiar to the individ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>ual,
runs through his poems. He is far less the mouthpiece of
the heavenly Muse than a man like ourselves, touching his lyre at
times with a divine grace, and then again sweeping the chords
with a fretfulness that draws some jarring notes.</p>

<p>We learn from the hexameters of Hesiod that he was born at
Ascra in B&#339;otia (<i>Works and Days</i>, line 640). His father was an
emigrant from &AElig;olian Kum&eacute;, whence he came to Ascra in search
of better fortune, "forsaking not plenty nor yet wealth and happiness,
but evil poverty which Zeus gives to men: near Helicon he
dwelt in a sorry village, Ascra, bad in winter, rigorous in summer
heat, at no time genial." From the exordium of the <i>Theogony</i>
(line 23) it appears that Hesiod kept sheep upon the slopes of
Helicon; for it was there that the Muse descended to visit him,
and, after rebuking the shepherds for their idleness and grossness,
gave him her sacred laurel-branch and taught him song. On this
spot, as he tells us in the <i>Works and Days</i> (line 656), he offered
the first prize of victory which he obtained at Chalkis. It would
seem clear from these passages that poetry had been recognized
as an inspiration, cultivated as an art, and encouraged by public
contests long before the date of Hesiod.</p>

<p>Husbandry was despised in B&#339;otia, and the pastoral poet led a
monotonous and depressing life. The great event which changed
its even tenor was a lawsuit between himself and his brother Perses
concerning the division of their inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Perses, who
was an idle fellow, after spending his own patrimony, tried to get
that of Hesiod into his hands, and took his cause before judges
whom he bribed. Hesiod was forced to relinquish his property,
whereupon he retired from Ascra to Orchomenos. At Orchomenos
he probably passed the remainder of his days. This incident
explains why Hesiod dwelt so much upon the subject of
justice in his poem of the <i>Works and Days</i>, addressed to Perses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>&#924;&#8051;&#947;&#945; &#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#949; &#928;&#8051;&#961;&#963;&#951; he always calls this brother, as though, while
heaping the coals of good counsel upon his head, he wished to
humble his oppressor by the parade of moral and intellectual superiority.
Some of Hesiod's finest passages, his most intense and
passionate utterances, are wrung from him by the injustice he had
suffered; so true is the famous saying that poets</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Learn in suffering what they teach in song.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One parable will for the moment serve as a specimen of the poetry
which the wrong-dealing of Perses drew from him. "Thus
spake the hawk to the nightingale of changeful throat, as he bore
her far aloft among the clouds, the prey of his talons: she, poor
wretch, wailed piteously in the grip of his crooked claws; but he
insultingly addressed her: 'Wretch, why criest thou? Thou art
now the prey of one that is the stronger; and thou shalt go whither
I choose to take thee, song-bird as thou art. Yea, if I see fit,
I will make my supper of thee, or else let thee go. A fool is he
who kicks against his betters: of victory is he robbed, and suffers
injury as well as insult.'" Hesiod himself is, of course, meant by
the nightingale, and the hawk stands for violence triumphing over
justice.</p>

<p>In verse and dialect the Hesiodic poems are not dissimilar from
the Homeric, which, supposing their date to have been later, proves
that the <i>Iliad</i> had determined the style and standard of epic composition,
or, supposing a contemporary origin, would show that the
Greeks of the so-called heroic age had agreed upon a common literary
language. We may refer the <i>Theogony</i> and the <i>Works and
Days</i>, after the deduction of numerous interpolations, to Hesiod,
but only in the same sense and with the same reservation as we
assign the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> to Homer.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Unlike the heroic
epos, they were recited, not to the accompaniment of the cithara,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>but by the poet standing with a laurel staff, called &#8165;&#8049;&#946;&#948;&#959;&#962; or &#963;&#954;&#8134;&#960;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;,
in his hand. Hesiod, at the opening of the <i>Theogony</i>, tells
us how he had received a staff of this kind from the Muse upon
Mount Helicon. Either, then, the laurel &#8165;&#945;&#946;&#948;&#959;&#962; had already been
recognized in that part of Greece as the symbol of the poet's office,
or else, from the respect which the followers of Hesiod paid
to the details of his poem, they adopted it as their badge.</p>

<p>Of the two poems ascribed to Hesiod, the <i>Theogony</i> and the
<i>Works and Days</i>, the former&mdash;though its genuineness as a Hesiodic
production seems to have been disputed from a very early
period&mdash;was, perhaps, on the whole, of greater value than the latter
to the Greeks. It contained an authorized version of the genealogy
of their gods and heroes, an inspired dictionary of mythology,
from which to deviate was hazardous. Just as families in
England try to prove their Norman descent by an appeal to the
Roll of Battle Abbey, so the canon of the <i>Theogony</i> decided the
claims of god or demi-god to rank among celestials. In this sense
Herodotus should be interpreted when he says that Hesiod joined
with Homer in making their Theogonia for the Greeks. But
though this poem had thus a unique value for the ancients, it is
hardly so interesting in the light of modern criticism as the <i>Works
and Days</i>. The <i>Works and Days</i>, while for all practical purposes
we may regard it as contemporaneous with the <i>Iliad</i>, marks the
transition from the heroic epic to the moral poetry of the succeeding
age, and forms the basis of direct ethical philosophy in
Hellas. Hesiod is thus not only the mouthpiece of obscure hand-workers
in the earliest centuries of Greek history, the poet of their
daily labors, sufferings, and wrongs, the singer of their doubts and
infantine reflections on the world in which they had to toil; he
is also the immediate parent of gnomic verse, and the ancestor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>those deep thinkers who speculated in the Attic age upon the
mysteries of human life.</p>

<p>The first ten verses of the <i>Works and Days</i> are spurious&mdash;borrowed,
probably, from some Orphic hymn to Zeus, and recognized
as not the work of Hesiod by critics as ancient as Pausanias. The
poem begins with these words: "Not, as I thought, is there only
one kind of strife; but on the earth there are two, the one praiseworthy,
the other to be blamed." It has been conjectured that
Hesiod is referring to that passage of the <i>Theogony</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> in which
Eris, daughter of Night, is said to have had no sister. We are,
therefore, justified in assuming that much of his mythology is
consciously etymological; and this should be borne in mind while
dealing with the legend of Prometheus. The strife whereof he
speaks in his exordium is what we should now call competition.
It rouses the idle man to labor; it stirs up envy in the heart
of the poor man, making him eager to possess the advantages
of wealth; it sets neighbor against neighbor, craftsman against
craftsman, in commendable emulation. Very different, says the
poet, is this sort of strife from that which sways the law-courts;
and at this point he begins to address his brother Perses, who had
litigiously deprived him of his heritage. The form of didactic
poetry, as it has since been practised by the followers of Hesiod,
was fixed by the appeal to Perses. Empedocles, it will be remembered,
addressed his poem on Nature to the physician Pausanias;
Lucretius invoked the attention of Memmius, and Virgil that of
M&aelig;cenas; the gnomes of Theognis were uttered to the Megarian
Cyrnus; Poliziano dedicated his <i>Silva</i> to Lorenzo de' Medici,
Vida his <i>Poetics</i> to the Dauphin, Fracastorio his medical poem to
Bembo, and Pope the <i>Essay on Man</i> to Bolingbroke. After this
preface on competition as the inducement to labor, and on strife
as the basis of injustice, the poet proceeds to the mythus of Prometheus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>which is so artificially introduced as to justify the opinion
that it may be an interpolation by some later craftsman of
the Hesiodic school. Work, he says, is necessary for men, because
Zeus has concealed and hidden far away our means of livelihood;
so that we are forced to toil and suffer in the search for
sustenance. This grudge Zeus owed mankind because of the sin
of Prometheus. In the <i>Works and Days</i> the account given of
the trick played upon Zeus is brief; Hesiod only says, "seeing
that Prometheus of crooked counsel deceived him." We may,
however, supplement the story from the <i>Theogony</i>.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In old days
the human race had fire, and offered burnt sacrifice to heaven;
but Prometheus by his craft deceived the gods of their just portion
of the victims, making Zeus take the bones and fat for his
share. Whereupon Zeus deprived men of the use of fire. Prometheus
then stole fire from heaven and gave it back to men.
"Then," says Hesiod, "was cloud-gathering Zeus full wroth of
heart, and he devised a great woe for all mankind." He determined
to punish the whole race by giving them Pandora. He
bade Heph&aelig;stus mix earth and water, and infuse into the plastic
form a human voice and human powers, and liken it in all points
to a heavenly goddess. Athene was told to teach the woman,
thus made, household work and skill in weaving. Aphrodite
poured upon her head the charm of beauty, with terrible desire,
and flesh-consuming thoughts of love. But Zeus commanded
Hermes to give to her the mind of a dog and wily temper. After
this fashion was the making of Pandora. And when she had
been shaped, Athene girded and adorned her; the Graces and divine
Persuasion hung golden chains about her flesh, and the
Hours crowned her with spring blossoms. Zeus called her Pandora,
because each dweller on Olympus had bestowed on her a
gift. Then Pandora was sent under the charge of Hermes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>Epimetheus, who remembered not his brother's words, how he
had said: "Receive no gift from Zeus, but send it back again,
lest evil should befall the race of men." But as soon as Epimetheus
had housed her he recognized his error. Before this time
men had lived upon the earth apart from evils, apart from painful
toil, and weariful diseases which bring death on mortals. The
woman with her hands lifted the lid of the great jar where all
these bad things were shut up, and let them loose into the air.
Hope alone remained behind&mdash;for the lot of humanity is hopeless;
but a hundred thousand woes abode at large to plague the
race of men. Earth is full of them; the sea is full; and sickness
roams abroad by night and day, where it listeth, bearing ills to
mortals in silence, for Zeus in his deep craft took away its voice
that men might have no warning. Thus not in any way is it possible
to avoid the will of God.</p>

<p>Such is the mythus of the Fall, as imagined by the early
Greeks. Man in rebellion against heaven, pitted in his weakness
at a game of mutual deception against almighty force, is beaten
and is punished. Woman, the instrument of his chastisement, is
thrust upon him by offended and malignant deity; the folly of
man receives her, and repents too late. Both his wisdom and his
foolishness conspire to man's undoing&mdash;wisdom which he cannot
use aright, and foolishness which makes him fall into the trap
prepared for him. We are irresistibly led to compare this legend
with the Hebrew tradition of the Fall. In both there is an act of
transgression on the part of man. Woman in both brings woe
into the world. That is to say, the conscience of the Greeks and
Jews, intent on solving the mystery of pain and death, convicted
them alike of sin; while the social prejudices of both races made
them throw the blame upon the weaker but more fascinating sex,
by whom they felt their sterner nature softened and their passions
quickened to work foolishness. So far the two myths have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
strong points of agreement. But in that of the Greeks there is
no Manich&aelig;ism. The sin of Prometheus is not, like the sin of
Adam, the error of weak human beings tempted by the power of
evil to transgress the law of good. It is rather a knavish trick
played off upon the sire of gods and men by a wily gamester;
and herein it seems to symbolize that tendency to overreach
which formed a marked characteristic of the Hellenes in all ages.
The Greek of Hesiod's time conceived of the relations between
man and god as involving mutual mistrust and guile; his ideal of
intellectual superiority, both in Prometheus and in Zeus, implied
capacity for getting the upper hand by craft. Again, the Greek
god takes a diabolical revenge, punishing the whole human race,
with laughter on his lips and self-congratulation for superior cunning
in his heart. We lack the solemn moment when God calls
Adam at the close of day, and tells him of the curse, but also
promises a Saviour. The legend of Prometheus has, for its part
also, the prophecy of a redeemer; but the redeemer of men from
the anger of God does not proceed from the mercy of the deity
himself, who has been wronged, but from the iron will of Fate,
who stands above both god and man, and from the invincible fortitude
of the soul which first had sinned, now stiffening itself
against the might of Zeus, refusing his promises, rejecting his
offers of reconciliation, biding in pain and patience till Herakles
appears and cuts the Gordian knot. This is the spectacle presented
by &AElig;schylus in his <i>Prometheus Bound</i>. To deny its grandeur
would be ridiculous; to contend that it offers some features
of sublimity superior to anything contained in the Hebrew legend
would be no difficult task. In the person of Prometheus,
chained on Caucasus, pierced by fiery arrows in the noonday and
by frosty arrows in the night, humanity wavers not, but endures
with scorn and patience and stoical acceptance. Unfortunately
the outlines of this great tragic allegory have been blurred <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>by
time and travestied by feeble copyists. What we know about
the tale of Prometheus is but a faint echo of the mythus apprehended
by the Greeks anterior to Hesiod, and handled afterwards
by &AElig;schylus. Enough, however, remains to make it certain that
it was the creation of a race profoundly convinced of present injustice
in the divine government of the world. If the soul of
man is raised by the attribution of stern heroism, God is lowered
to the infamy of a tyrant. But neither is the Hebrew legend on
its side theologically flawless. Greek and Jew fail alike to offer
a satisfactory solution of the origin of evil. While in the Greek
mythus Zeus plays with mankind like a cat with a mouse, the
Hebrew story does not explain the justice of that omnipotent
Being who created man with capacity for error, and exposed him
to temptation. The true critique of the second and third chapters
of Genesis has been admirably expressed by Omar Khayyam
in the following stanzas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Thou, who didst with pitfall and with gin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beset the road I was to wander in,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou wilt not with predestination round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enmesh me, and impute my fall to sin?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Thou, who man of baser earth didst make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who with Eden didst devise the snake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For all the sin wherewith the face of man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is blackened, man's forgiveness give&mdash;and take!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Both tales are but crude and early attempts to set forth the primitive
mystery of conscience, and to account for the prevalence of
pain and death. The &aelig;sthetic superiority of the Hebrew conception
lies in its idealization of the deity at all costs. God is at
least grand and consistent, justified by his own august counsels;
and at the very moment of punishing his creatures, he promises
deliverance through their own seed. Moreover, a vast antagonis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>tic
agency of evil is brought into the field to account for the
fall of man; and we are not precluded from even extending our
compassion to the deity, who has been thwarted in his schemes
for good.</p>

<p>Before quitting the discussion of this ancient tale of human
suffering and sin, it would be well to notice that Hesiod identifies
Prometheus with the human race. His hero is the son of
the Titan Iapetus by Clymene, daughter of the Titan Oceanus;
and his brethren are Atlas, Menoitios, and Epimetheus. These
names are significant. Just as Prometheus signifies the forecasting
reason of humanity,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> so Epimetheus indicates the overhasty
judgment foredoomed to be wise too late. These are
intellectual qualities. Atlas, in like manner, typifies the endurance
of man, who bears all to the very end, and holds upon his
back the bulk of heaven. In Menoitios is shadowed forth the insolence
and rebellious spirit for which a penalty of pain and death
is meted. These, then, are moral qualities. In the children of
Iapetus and Clymene we consequently trace the first rude attempt
at psychological analysis. The scientific import of the mythus
was never wholly forgotten by the Greeks. Pindar calls Prophasis,
or excuse, the daughter of Epimetheus, or back-thought as opposed
to fore-thought. Plato makes the folly of Epimetheus to
have consisted in his giving away the natural powers of self-preservation
to the beasts; whereupon Prometheus was driven to supplement
with fire the unprotected impotence of man. Lucian,
again, says of Epimetheus that repentance is his business; while
Synesius adds that he provides not for the future, but deplores
the past. The Titans, it should further be remarked, are demiurgic
powers&mdash;elemental forces of air, fire, earth, water&mdash;conditions
of existence implied by space and time&mdash;distributors of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>darkness and of light&mdash;parents, lastly, of the human race. Though
some later Greek authors identified Prometheus with the Titans,
and made him the benefactor of humanity, this was not the
conception of Hesiod. Prometheus is stated, both in the <i>Theogony</i>
and the <i>Works and Days</i>, to have been the son of Titans,
the protagonist of men, who strove in vain to cope with Zeus.
Zeus himself belongs in like manner to a secondary order of existences.
Begotten by the Titan Kronos, he seems to typify the
reason as distinguished from the brute powers of the universe,
mind emergent from matter, and overcoming it by contest. Prometheus
is connected, by his parentage, with the old material order
of the world; but he represents that portion of it which is human,
and which, <i>qua</i> human, has affinity to Zeus. Herein we
trace the mystery of the divine in man, though man has been
placed in antagonism to the deity. The same notion is further
symbolized by the theft of fire, and by the fiction of Prometheus
breathing a particle of the divine spirit into the clay figures
whereof he made men. In the decaying age of Greek mythology
this aspect of the legend absorbed attention to the exclusion of
the elder Hesiodic romance, as students of Horace will remember,
and as appears abundantly from Gr&aelig;co-Roman bass-reliefs. To
reconcile man and Zeus, cognate in their origin, yet hostile owing
to their ancient feud, it was needful that a deliverer, Herakles,
should be born of god and woman, of Zeus and Alcmene, who
sets free the elementary principle of humanity typified in Prometheus,
and for the first time establishes a harmony between the
children of earth and the dwellers on Olympus. So far I have
remained within the limits of the Hesiodic legend, only hinting
at such divergences as were adopted by the later handlers of the
tale. The new aspect given to the whole myth by &AElig;schylus deserves
separate consideration in connection with the tragedy of
<i>Prometheus</i>. It is to be regretted that we only po<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>ssess so important
a relique of Greek religious speculation in fragments; and these
fragments are so tantalizingly incomplete that it is impossible to
say exactly how much may be the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of original tradition, or
where the free fancy of later poets has been remoulding and recasting
the material of the antique myth to suit more modern allegory.</p>

<p>The tale of Prometheus may be called the first canto of the
<i>Works and Days</i>. The second consists of the vision of the four
ages of man. Hesiod, in common with all early poets, imagined
a state of primeval bliss, which he called the Age of Gold. Then
Kronos reigned upon the earth, and men lived without care or
pain or old age. Their death was like the coming on of sleep,
and the soil bore them fruits untilled. When this race came to
an end, Zeus made them genii of good-will, haunting the world
and protecting mortals. Theirs it is to watch the decrees of justice,
and to mark wrong-doing, wrapped around with mist, going
up and down upon the earth, the givers of wealth; such is the
royal honor which is theirs. The next age he calls the Silver, for
it was inferior to the first; and Zeus speedily swept it away, seeing
that the men of this generation waxed insolent, and paid no
honor to the gods. The third age is the Brazen. A terrible and
mighty brood of men possessed the land, who delighted in naught
but violence and warfare. They first ate flesh. Their houses
and their armor and their mattocks were of brass. In strife they
slew themselves, and perished without a name. After them came
the heroes of romance, whom Zeus made most just and worthy.
They fell fighting before seven-gated Thebes and Troy; but after
death Father Zeus transferred them to the utmost limits of the
world, where they live without care in islands of the blest, by ocean
waves, blest heroes, for whom thrice yearly the soil bears blooming
fruitage honey-sweet. Then cries Hesiod, and the cry is
wrenched from him with agony, Would that I had never been
born in the fifth generation of men, but rather that I ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>d died
before or had lived afterwards; for now the age is of iron! On
the face of the world there is naught but violence and wrong;
division is set between father and son, brother and brother, friend
and friend; there is no fear of God, no sense of justice, no fidelity,
no truth; the better man is subject to the worse, and jealousy
corrupts the world. Soon, very soon, will wing their way to
heaven again&mdash;leaving the earth with her broad ways, robed in
white raiment, joining the immortal choir, deserting men&mdash;both
modest shame and righteous indignation. But dismal woes will
stay and harbor here, and against evil there shall be no aid. This
ends the second canto of the <i>Works and Days</i>, and brings us
down to the two hundredth line of the poem. The remainder
consists for the most part of precepts adapted to the doleful state
in which mortals of the present have to suffer.</p>

<p>What may be called the third canto is occupied with justice,
the advantages of which, from a purely utilitarian point of view,
as well as &aelig;sthetically conceived, are urged in verse. It begins
with the apologue of the hawk and nightingale already quoted.
Then the condition of a city where justice is honored, where the
people multiply in peace, and there is fulness and prosperity,
where pestilence and calamity keep far away, is contrasted with
the plagues, wars, famines, wasting away of population, and perpetual
discomforts that beset the unjust nation. For the innocent
and righteous folk, says the poet, the earth bears plenty, and
in the mountains the oak-tree at the top yields acorns, and in the
middle bees, and the woolly sheep are weighed down with their
fleeces. The women give birth to children like their fathers.
With blessings do men always flourish, nor need they tempt the
sea in ships, but earth abundantly supplies their wants.</p>

<p>It is worth while to pause for a moment and contemplate the
pastoral ideal of perfect happiness and pure simplicity which,
first set forth by Hesiod in these passages, found afterwards <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>an
echo in Plato, in Empedocles, in Lucretius, in Virgil, in Poliziano,
and in Tasso; all of whom have lingered lovingly upon the <i>bell'
et&agrave; dell' oro</i>. The Hesiodic conception of felicity is neither stirring
nor heroic. Like the early Christian notion of heaven, expressed
by the pathetic iteration of <i>in pace</i> on the sepulchral
tablets of the catacombs, it owes its beauty to a sense of contrast
between tranquillity imagined and woe and warfare actually experienced.
We comprehend why the Spartan king called Hesiod
the poet of the Helots, when, in the age that idealized Achilles
and Odysseus, the all-daring, all-affronting heroes of a radiant romance,
we find that his sole aspiration was to live in peace, decorously
fulfilling social duties, and growing old in the routine of
moderate labor. It is a commonplace, and what the French
would call a <i>bourgeois</i>, aspiration. Just this lot in life Achilles
rejected with disdain, in exchange for the dazzling prospect of
victory and death, that fascinated the noblest of the Greeks, and
produced their Alexander. Still we must remember that Hesiod
was not, like Homer, singing in the halls of fiery and high-fed
chieftains, who stood above the laws. His plaintive note was uttered
to the watchers of the seasons and the tillers of the soil,
whose very livelihood depended on the will and pleasure of &#948;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8049;&#947;&#959;&#953;
&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#962;. In the semi-barbarous state of society which Homer
and Hesiod represent from different points of view, when
violence prevails, and when life and property alike are insecure,
justice may well be selected as the prime of virtues, and peace be
idealized as heaven on earth. In one sense, as the Greek philosophers
argued, justice does include all the excellences of a social
being. The man who is perfectly just will be unimpeachable in
all his conduct; and the simpler the state of society, the more
outrageous the wrongs inflicted by one man on another, the more
apparent will this be.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<p>Putting aside, however, for further consideration, the ethical
aspect of Hesiod's ideal, we find in it an exquisite and permanently
attractive &aelig;sthetic beauty. Compared with the fierce
heroism of Achilles, the calm happiness of Hesiod's pastoral folk
soothes our fancy, like the rising of the moon in twilight above
harvest sheaves at the end of a long intolerable day. Therefore
great poets and artists, through all the resonant and gorgeous
ages of the world, have turned their eyes with sympathy and
yearning to these lines; and the best that either Virgil or Poliziano
could achieve was to catch an echo of Hesiod's melody, to
reproduce a portion of his charm. Perhaps the most complete
homage to the poetry of Hesiod on this point has been rendered
by Flaxman. Nature, so prodigal to the English race in men of
genius untutored, singular, and solitary, has given us but few seers
who, in the quality of prolific invention, can be compared with
Flaxman. For pure conceptive faculty, controlled by unerring
sense of beauty, we have to think of Pheidias or Raphael before
we find his equal. His powers were often employed on uncongenial
subjects; nor had he, perhaps, a true notion of the limitations
of his art, else he would not have attempted to give sculpturesque
form, even in outline, to many scenes from the <i>Divine
Comedy</i>. The conditions, again, of modern life were adverse to
his working out his thought in marble, and precluded him from
gaining a complete mastery over the material of sculpture. It
may also be conceded that, to a large extent, his imagination,
like a parasite flower, was obliged to bloom upon the branches
of Greek art. What Flaxman would have been without the bass-reliefs,
the vases, and the hand-mirrors of the ancients, it is difficult
to conceive. Herein, however, he did no more than obey
the law which has constrained the greatest modern minds by indissoluble
bondage to the service of the Greek spirit. Allowing
for all this, the fact remains that within a certain circle, the radius
of which exceeds the farthest reach of many far more frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
be-lauded artists, Flaxman was supreme. Whatever could be expressed
according to the laws of bass-relief, embossed in metal, or
hewn out of stone, or indicated in pure outline, he conveyed with
a truth to nature, a grace of feeling, and an originality of conception
absolutely incomparable. Moreover, in this kind his genius
was inexhaustible. Nowhere are the fruits of his creative skill
so charming as in the illustrations of the <i>Works and Days</i>. The
ninth plate, in which the Age of Gold is symbolized by a mother
stretching out her infant to receive his father's kiss, might be
selected as a perfect idyl, conveyed within the strictest and severest
bounds of sculptural relief. The man and his girl-wife are
beautiful and young. Age, we feel, will never touch them, by
whitening her forehead or spoiling his smooth chin with hair.
Both are naked, seated on the ground; their outstretched arms
enfold, as in a living cradle, the robust and laughing boy. On
one side shoots a heavy sheaf of barley; on the other stands an
altar, smoking with bloodless offerings to heaven; above, the
strong vine hangs its clusters and its wealth of lusty leaves.
More elaborate, but scarcely more beautiful&mdash;like a double rose
beside a wilding blossom from the hedge of June&mdash;is the seventeenth
plate, which sets forth the felicity of god-fearing folk who
honor justice. These, too, are seated on the ground, young men
and girls, with comely children, pledges of their joy. One child
is suckled at her mother's breast; another lies folded in his father's
arms; a girl and boy are kissing on their parents' knees;
while a beardless youth pipes ditties on the double reed. Above
the group vine-branches flourish, and the veiled Hours, givers of
all goodly things, weave choric dance with song, scattering from
their immortal fingers flowers upon the men beneath. In order
to comprehend the purity of Flaxman's inspiration, the deep and
inborn sympathy that made him in this nineteenth century a
Greek, we ought to compare these illustrations with the pi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>cture
of the Golden Age by Ingres. For perfection of scientific drawing
from the nude, this masterpiece of the great French painter
has never been excelled. It is a treasure-house of varied attitude
and rhythmically studied line. Yet the whole resembles a theatrical
<i>tableau vivant</i>, which an enlightened choreograph, in combination
with an enterprising manager, might design to represent
the Garden of Eden on a grand scale. The power displayed by
Flaxman is of a very different order. There is no effort, no <i>mise
en sc&egrave;ne</i>, no parade of science, no suggestion of voluptuousness.
His outlines are as simple and as pure as Hesiod's verse. We
feel that, whereas Ingres is using the old vision as a schema for
the exhibition of his skill, Flaxman has felt its poetry and given
form to its imagination. This is not the occasion to linger over
these illustrations; yet, before closing the volume that contains
them, I cannot forbear from turning a page, and pointing to the
pictures of the Pleiads. Seven beautiful interwoven female shapes
are rising, in the one plate, like a wreath of light or vapor moulded
into human form, above the reapers; in the other are descending,
with equal grace of now inverted movement, over the ploughman
at his toil. By no other artist's hand have the constellations
elsewhere been converted, with so much feeling for their form,
into the melodies of rhythmically moving human shapes. Flaxman's
outlines of the Pleiads might be described as a new celestial
imagery, a hitherto unapprehended astronomical mythology.</p>

<p>Continuing what I have called the third canto of the <i>Works
and Days</i>, Hesiod addresses himself in the next place to the
Basileis, or judges of the people: "Kings in judgment, do ye
also ponder this divine justice; for the immortals, dwelling near
and among men, behold who waste their fellows by wrong judgment,
scorning the wrath of God. Verily, upon earth are thrice
ten thousand immortals of the host of Zeus, guardians of mortal
man. They watch both justice and injustice, robed in mist, roam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>ing
abroad upon the earth." Again he reminds them that Justice,
virgin child of Zeus, is ever ready with ear open to observe
the injury to right and fair dealing done against her honor. She
complains of the wrongful judge; but it is the people who suffer
for his sin. Therefore let the princes so greedy of bribes take
heed, forego their crooked sentences, and bear in mind that the
man who works evil for another, works it for himself, that bad
intentions harm those who have conceived them, and that Zeus
sees all and knows all. This period is concluded with a bitterly
ironical repudiation of the poet's own precepts: May neither I nor
my son be just; for now the wrongful man has by far the best of
it upon the earth! It will be observed that Zeus throughout this
tirade on justice is a different being from the Zeus in the mythus
of Prometheus. The dramatic personage of the legend, whose
guile inflicts so much misery on men, has been supplanted by a
moral idea personified. It is not that a new mythology has been
superinduced upon the old one, or that we are now in the track
of esoteric religious teaching: the poet is only expressing his internal
certainty that though fraud and violence prevail on earth,
yet somewhere in the eternal and ideal world justice still abides.
It is not a little singular, considering his querulous and hopeless
tone in other passages, that Hesiod should here assert the cognizance
which Zeus takes of unfair dealing, and the continued
action of protective and retributive d&aelig;mons. We could scarcely
find stronger faith in the superiority of justice among the moral
writings of the Jews. Furthermore, Hesiod reminds Perses
that justice is human, violence bestial, and that in the long run
honesty will be found to be the best policy. Then follows the
sublimest passage of the whole poem&mdash;one of great celebrity
among the Greeks, who quoted it, and worked it up in poems,
parables, and essays: "Behold, thou mayest choose badness easily,
even in heaps; for the path is plain, and she dwells very near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>.
But before excellence the immortal gods have placed toil and labor:
afar and steep is the road that leads to her, and rough it is
at first; but when you reach the height, then truly is it easy,
though so hard before."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The subject of Justice being now exhausted, Hesiod passes, in
the fourth canto of the <i>Works and Days</i>, to the eulogy of labor,
regarded as the source of all good. The unheroic nature of his
life-philosophy is very apparent in this section. He thinks and
speaks like a peasant, whose one idea it is to add pence to pence,
and to cut a good figure in his parish. A man must work in order
to avoid hunger and grow rich: gods and men hate the idle,
who are like drones in the hive: if you work, you will get flocks
and herds, and folk will envy you: to grow rich from dishonest
gains brings no profit, for they are unlucky: the great aim for
a good man is to live a respectable life, to work soberly, to fulfil
righteousness, to be punctual in paying homage to the gods&mdash;to
go to church, in fact&mdash;with this end in view, that he may buy the
estates of his neighbor, instead of having to sell his own. Such
is the bathos of Hesiod's ethical ideal: Do right and abstain
from wrong, in order that you may be richer than the tenant of
the adjacent farm. Many other precepts of like tenor might be
quoted: Call your friend to your banquet, and leave your enemy
alone: invite him most who lives nearest, for he will be most useful
in time of need: love him who loves you, and cleave to him
who cleaves to you: give to him who gives, and give not to him
who gives not, for to a giver gifts are given, but to him who gives
not no man hath given. Of such sort are the Hesiodic rules of
conduct. They reveal the spirit of a prudent clown, the practical
and calculating selfishness which the doleful conditions of the
early age of Hellenic civilization intensified. The social life of
great political centres and the patriotism of the Persian war helped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>at a later period to raise the Greeks above these low and sordid
aims in life. It was only in a century when justice could be
bought and penury meant starving, unheeded or derided, by the
roadside, that a poet of Hesiod's temper could write,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Money is a
man's soul&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>In criticising the Solonian reforms at Athens, we should never
forget the dismal picture of Hellenic misery revealed to us by
Hesiod.</p>

<p>Thus ends the first part of the <i>Works and Days</i>. The second
half of the poem consists of rules for husbandry. Hesiod goes
through the seasons of the year, detailing the operations of the
several months, and adorning his homely subject with sober but
graceful poetry. It is an elegant farmer's calendar, upon which
Virgil founded his <i>Georgics</i>, translating into Augustan Latin the
rude phrases of the bard of Ascra, and turning all he touched to
gold. Scattered among precepts relating to the proper seasons
and successions of agricultural labor are descriptive passages and
moral reflections. One picture of winter is so long and elaborate
as to justify the notion that it is a separate interpolated poem.
The episode upon procrastination (line 408) and the rules for the
choice of a wife (line 693) might be selected as offering special
topics for comment. The latter passage deserves particular attention;
since, if the condition of the working-man was wretched
in this early age of Greece, far more miserable, may we argue, was
that of his helpmate. A man, according to Hesiod, ought to be
about thirty when he marries, and his wife about nineteen. He
should be very careful in choosing her, to insure that she will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>bring him into contempt among his neighbors; and he must remember
that if a good wife be a prize, it is not possible to get a
worse plague than a bad one. What his general notion about
women was, we gather from the long invective against the female
sex in the <i>Theogony</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Pandora was the greatest curse imaginable
to the human race, for from her sprang women; and now, if a
man refrains from marriage, he must endure a wretched old age,
and leave his money to indifferent kindred; or if he marries and
gets a good wife, curses and blessings are mingled in his lot; if
his wife be of the bad sort, his whole life is ruined. So utterly
impossible is it to avoid the misery devised for the human race
by Zeus.</p>

<p>The whole argument of Hesiod in this passage, taken in connection
with his few lines on the choice of a wife in the <i>Works
and Days</i>, and with his grim silence upon the subject of women
as the companions of men, proves that he regarded them as a
necessary deduction from the happiness of life&mdash;the rift within
the lute that spoils its music&mdash;the plague invented by the malice
of an all-wise god in vengeance for a man's deceit. This appreciation
of women is substantially consistent with the curious
poem by Simonides of Amorgos; with the treatment of the female
sex at Athens; with the opinion of Pindar and Plato that
to be a woman-lover as compared with a boy-lover was sensual
and vile; with the disdainful silence of Thucydides; with the
caricatures of society presented by the comic poets; with the famous
epigram of Pericles; with the portrait of Xanthippe; and
with the remarkable description of female habits in Lucian's
<i>Amores</i>. Thus, running through the whole literature of the
Greeks, we can trace a vein of contempt for women, which may
fairly be indicated as the greatest social blot upon their brilliant
but imperfect civilization. Exceptions can, of course, be found.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>In the age of the despots women rose into far more importance
than they afterwards enjoyed in democratic Athens. At Sparta
their right to engross property (severely criticised by Aristotle)
gave them a social status which they had in no other Greek state.
At Lesbos, during the brief blooming period of &AElig;olian culture,
in freedom of action and in mental training they were at least the
equals of the male sex. The fact, however, remains that in Athens,
the real centre of Hellenic life, women occupied a distinctly inferior
rank. It is significant that in the <i>Lives of Plutarch</i>, whereas
we read of many noble Laced&aelig;monian ladies, comparatively
little account is taken of the wives or mothers of Athenian worthies.</p>

<p>Some scattered proverbs about the conduct of the tongue and
the choice of friends, followed by an enumeration of lucky and
unlucky days, and by a list of truly rustic rules of personal behavior,
conclude the poem of the <i>Works and Days</i>. How far these
saws and maxims belong to the original work of Hesiod it is quite
impossible to say. The book became popular in education, and
consequently suffered, like the gnomes of Theognis and Phocylides,
from frequent interpolations at a later period. As it stands,
the whole is chiefly valuable for the concrete picture which it offers
of early peasant life in Hellas. As the epics of Homer present
us with the ideal towards which the princes and great nobles
raised their souls amid the plenty and the splendor of their palaces,
so in the lines of Hesiod we learn how the Thetes, whom
Achilles envied in Elysium, toiled and suffered in their struggle
for their only source of comfort, gold.</p>

<p>It might well be questioned whether the founders of the Eleatic
School deserve to rank among Greek poets; for though they
wrote hexameters, composing what the Greeks call &#7956;&#960;&#951;, yet it is
clear that they did this with no artistic impulse, but only because
in the dawn of thought it was easier to use verse than prose for
fixed and meditated exposition. The moment in the development
of human thought when abstractions were being wrung for the
first time with toil from language, and when as yet the vehicle of
rhythmic utterance seemed indispensable, is so interesting that a
point in favor of Xenophanes and Parmenides may be fairly
stretched, and a place may be given them between Hesiod, the
creator of didactic poetry, and Empedocles, the inspired predecessor
of Lucretius.</p>

<p>The problem which lay before the earliest philosophers of
Greece was how to emerge from mythological conceptions concerning
the origin and nature of the world into a region of more
exact and abstract thought. They had their list of demiu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>rgic
agencies, Titans and deities, some of them dramatically personified
in the poems of Homer and the legends of Olympus, others but
vaguely indicated by the names of Earth and Ocean, Heaven and
Time. The polytheistic and mythologizing instincts of the race
at large tended to individualize these primal powers with more
and more distinctness, collecting legends around the more popular
among them, and attributing moral sympathies and passions to
those who were supposed to have relations with humanity. But
there remained a background of dimly descried and cloudy forces
upon which the mythop&#339;ic imagination had taken little hold;
and these supplied a starting-point for scientific speculation. It
was in this field that the logical faculty of the Greek mind, no
less powerful and active than its poetic fancy, came first into play.
Thus we find Thales brooding in thought upon the mythus of
Oceanus, and arriving at the conception of water as the elementary
principle of the universe; while Gaia, or Earth, in like manner
is said to have stimulated Pherecydes. Anaximenes is reported
to have chosen air as the groundwork of his cosmogony, and
Heraclitus developed the material world from fire.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that any of these early speculators invented
a complete hypothesis for deducing phenomena from earth,
air, fire, or water as apprehended by the senses. Their elements,
or &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#8055;, are rather to be regarded in the light of symbols&mdash;metaphors
adopted from experience for shadowing forth an extremely
subtle and pervasive substance, a material of supersensible fluidity
and elasticity, capable of infinite modification by rarefaction
and condensation. At the same time they were seeking after
intellectual abstractions; but the problems of philosophy as yet
presented themselves in crude and concrete form to their intellects.</p>

<p>A further step in the direction of the abstract was taken by
Anaximander, the Milesian astronomer, who is reported to hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>e
made a sundial, to have calculated the recurrence of the equinoxes
and the solstices, and to have projected geographical charts for
the first time in Greece. This practical mathematician derived
the universe from the unlimited, &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#957;, hurling thought thus
at a venture, as it were, into the realm of metaphysical conceptions.
It would appear from the dim and hazy tradition which
we have received about Anaximander, that he instituted a polemic
against the so-called physicists, arguing that to the elements of
fire or water there can be attributed a beginning and an ending,
but that the abstract indefinite, as uncreate and indestructible,
takes precedence of all else. His thought, however, though fruitful
of future consequences, was in itself barren; nor have we any
reason to conclude that by the &#7940;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#957; he meant more than a primordial
substance, or <i>Grund</i>, without quality and without limitation&mdash;a
void and hollow form containing in itself potentialities of
all things. It is characteristic of this early age of Greek speculation
that Simplicius found it necessary to criticise even Anaximander
for using poetic phraseology, &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#969;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#8000;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;. In
his polemic, however, he started one of the great puzzles, the contrast
between birth and death, and the difficulty of discovering an
element subject to neither, which agitated the schools of Greece
throughout their long activity.</p>

<p>While the thinkers of Ionia were endeavoring to discover terms
of infinite subtlety, through which to symbolize the uniform and
unchangeable substance underlying the multiplicity of phenomena,
the Pythagoreans in Italy turned their attention to the abstract
relations of which numbers are the simplest expression.
Numbers, they saw, are both thoughts and also at the same time
universally applicable to things of sense. There is nothing tangible
which can escape the formul&aelig; of arithmetic. Mistaking a
power of the mind for a power inherent in the universe, they imagined
that the figures of the multiplication-table were the essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
realities of things, the authentic inner essence of the sensible
world; and to number they attributed a mystic potency. Speculation
was still so immature that they failed to observe the sterility
of the conception. This much, however, they effected: by
resting upon the essentially mental conception of quantity, and
by apprehending the whole universe as number, they took the first
important step in the direction of pure metaphysic.</p>

<p>Anaxagoras of Clazomen&aelig;, following another path, pronounced
that the really efficient agency in the universe is Mind. For this
utterance he has been justly eulogized by the metaphysicians of
all succeeding centuries. It was, in fact, the starting-point of
what in German phraseology is called <i>Begriffsphilosophie</i>. Anaxagoras
insisted on a point which had been neglected by his contemporaries&mdash;the
form-giving activity of mind, as known to us
immediately in the human reason&mdash;and asserted the impossibility
of leaving this out of the account of the universe. But, as Socrates
complained, he stopped here, and diverged into material explanations,
talking about attraction and repulsion and homogeneous
particles, without attempting to connect them with the action
of his &#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;.</p>

<p>Democritus of Abdera, a little later in time than the thinkers
who have hitherto been mentioned, was so attracted by the indefinite
divisibility of matter that he explained the universe by the
theory of a void in which an infinity of atoms moved and met in
varied combination. It is well known that this hypothesis, the
parent of the Epicurean and the Lucretian systems, has been the
main-stay of materialism in all ages, and that it has lately been received
into favor by some of the most advanced physicists. Yet
it must not be imagined that the Atomism of Democritus was in
any true sense scientific according to our acceptation of the term.
Like the Infinite of Anaximander, the Mind of Anaxagoras, the
Numbers of Pythagoras, the Fire of Heraclitus, his Plenum and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Vacuum was a conjectural hypothesis founded upon no experiment
or observation properly so called. All these early systems were
freaks of fancy, shrewd guesses, poetic thoughts, in which abstractions
from language, elementary refinements upon mythology, together
with crude speculations about natural objects, were made
the groundwork of dogmatism. At the same time thought at
this period was both active and creative; nearly all the permanent
problems which occur to human ignorance&mdash;the antitheses of a
beginning and an ending, of being and not being, of rest and motion,
of the continuous and the discrete, of the one and the many&mdash;the
criterion of knowledge and opinion, the antagonism of the
senses and the reason, the relation of the vital principle to inanimate
existence&mdash;were posed in the course of animated controversy.
Logic had not been formulated as a method. Philosophical terminology
had not as yet been settled. But the logical faculty was
working in full vigor, and language was being made to yield abstractions
hitherto unapprehended.</p>

<p>This brief survey of the origin of Greek philosophy will enable
us to understand the position of the Eleatics. Regarded collectively,
and as a school developing a body of doctrine, they advanced
in abstraction beyond any of their predecessors or contemporaries.
Whereas other philosophers had sought for the abstract
in phenomenal elements, the Eleatics went straight through language
to the notion of pure being: even the numbers of Pythagoras
were not sufficient for the exigencies of their logic. The
unity of being, as the one reality, and the absolute impossibility
of not-being, revealed by the consciousness and demonstrated by
language in the copula &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;, forms the groundwork of their dogmatism.
How important was the principle thus introduced into
the fabric of European thought, is evident to every student of the
history of philosophy. It is enough in this place to point out to
what extent it has influenced our language through such words as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
entity, existence, essence. The Eleatics may claim as their own
coinage the title of all metaphysics&mdash;Ontology, or the Science of
Being.</p>

<p>In order to make the attitude of these earliest Greek thinkers
still more clear, we must return for a moment to Heraclitus, who
instituted a polemic against the Eleatic doctrine of Being. He asserted
that Being is no more than not-Being. Regarded in itself
as an abstraction, Being turns out to be identical with nothing.
The relation of Being to not-Being in Becoming formed the central
point of his metaphysic, and was enunciated in the axiom,
All is flowing, &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#8165;&#949;&#8150;. Though the Heraclitean polemic was
directed against the school at large, it would be in the last degree
inaccurate to treat the Eleatic doctrine, as maintained by Xenophanes,
Parmenides, Zeno, and Melissus, from the point of view of
one consistent system. By so doing not only would the truth of
history be violated, but one of the most valuable examples of the
growth of thought in Greece would be lost.</p>

<p>Xenophanes, who is regarded as the founder of the school, was
a native of Colophon. He left his fatherland, and spent the
greater portion of his life in Sicily and Magna Gr&aelig;cia. We hear
of him first at Messana, then at Catana; and there is good reason
to believe that he visited the Phoc&aelig;an colony of Elea (afterwards
Velia) on the western coast of Calabria, a little to the south of
P&aelig;stum. At all events, antiquity spoke of him as the father of
philosophy at Elea, and Diogenes Laertius mentions a poem of
two thousand hexameters which he composed in joint praise of
this city and Colophon. Xenophanes lived to a great age. In a
couplet preserved from one of his elegies he speaks of having
wandered, absorbed in thought and contemplation, for sixty-seven
years through Hellas, and fixes twenty-five years as the age at
which he began his travels. He was celebrated, like his fellow-countryman,
Mimnermus, for his elegiac poetry, some fragments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of which are among the most valuable relics we possess of that
species of composition. About 538 B.C. is the date usually assigned
to him.</p>

<p>The starting-point of philosophy for Xenophanes was found in
theology. "Looking up to universal heaven," says Aristotle, "he
proclaimed that unity is God." The largest fragment of his metaphysical
poem consists of a polemic against polytheism, both as regards
the anthropomorphic conception of deity prevalent in Greece,
and also as regards the immorality attributed by Homer and Hesiod
to the gods. His own god is a high abstraction of mind, one
and indivisible, without motion, without beginning or ending, in
no way like to man. To the divine unity he attributed thought
and volition; but he does not appear to have attempted to connect
God with the universe. Like the other speculators of his
age and nation, he theoretically deduced the world from simple
elements, choosing earth and water, as we gather from some fragments
of his poem, for the primordial constituents. At the same
time he held a doctrine which afterwards became the central point
of Eleatic science. This was a disbelief in the evidence of the
senses, a despair of empirical knowledge, which contrasts singularly
with his own vehement dogmatism upon the nature of the
Divine Being. Thus the originality of Xenophanes consisted in
his pronouncing, without proof, that the universe must be regarded
as a unity, and that this unity is the Divine Existence, all human
mythology being but dreams and delusions. Of his philosophical
poem only inconsiderable portions have been preserved.
These, however, are sufficient to make clear the line he took, both
in his assertion of monotheism and his polemic against the anthropomorphic
theology of the Greeks. Such as they are, I have
translated them as follows:<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"One god there is, among gods and men the greatest, neither in body like
to mortals, nor in mind.</p>

<p>"With the whole of him he sees, with the whole of him he thinks, with the
whole of him he hears.</p>

<p>"Without exertion, by energy of mind he sways the universe of things.</p>

<p>"That he abides forever in the same state, without movement, or change
from place to place, is evident.</p>

<p>"But mortals fancy that gods come into being like themselves, and have
their senses, voice, and body. But, of a truth, if oxen or lions had hands, and
could draw with their hands, and make what men make, then horses like unto
horses, and oxen like unto oxen, would both paint the images of gods, and
shape their bodies also after the similitude of their own limbs.</p>

<p>"Homer and Hesiod attributed to gods everything that is disgraceful and
blameworthy among men, and very many lawless deeds of gods they recorded&mdash;theft,
adultery, and mutual deceit."</p></div>

<p>Another set of scattered fragments, small in number and meagre
in their information, from the poem by Xenophanes on &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#962;,
show that he held the views afterwards developed by Parmenides
concerning the uncertainty of human opinion, and that the elemental
substances which he favored in his cosmogonical theory
were earth and water. These also I have translated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For all of us from earth and water sprang.</p>

<p>"Earth and water are all things that come into being and have birth.</p>

<p>"The spring of water is the sea.</p>

<p>"This upper surface of the earth beneath our feet is open to the sight, and
borders on the air; but the lower parts reach down into infinity.</p>

<p>"What we call Iris, that also is a cloud, purple-dark, scarlet-bright, yellow-pale
to look upon.</p>

<p>"The very truth itself no man who hath been or will be can know concerning
gods and all whereof I speak; for though he publish the most absolute,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>yet even so he does not know: opinion is supreme o'er all things.</p>

<p>"These things are matters of opinion, shadows of the truth.</p>

<p>"Not from the beginning did gods reveal all things to mortals; but in
course of time by seeking they make progress in discovery."</p></div>

<p>The essential weakness of the Eleatic way of thinking was not
glaringly apparent, though implicit, in the utterance of Xenophanes.
This consisted in the unreconciled antithesis between the
world of unity, of true being, of rational thought, and the world
of multiplicity, of phenomenal appearance, of opinion. By pushing
the tenets of his master to their logical conclusions, and by
exchanging theological for metaphysical phraseology, Parmenides,
the greatest teacher of the school, exposed the fatal insufficiency
of Eleatic dualism. At the same time he achieved an ever-memorable
triumph in philosophy by forcing the problem of essential
reality upon the earliest Greek speculators, and by defining
the battle-ground of future ontological controversy.</p>

<p>Parmenides, a native of Elea, who flourished about the year
503 B.C., enjoyed a reputation in his native city scarcely inferior
to that of Pythagoras at Crotona, of Empedocles at Acragas, or
of Solon at Athens. Speusippus, quoted by Diogenes Laertius, asserts
that the magistrates of Elea were yearly sworn to observe
the laws enacted by Parmenides. Cebes talks about a "Pythagorean
or Parmenidean mode of life," as if the austere ascesis of
the Samian philosopher had been adopted or imitated by the
Eleatic. Indeed, there is good reason to suppose that Parmenides
held intercourse with members of the Pythagorean sect, his
neighbors in the south of Italy. Diogenes Laertius relates that
he was united in the bonds of closest friendship to Ameinias and
Dioch&aelig;tes, two Pythagoreans. Of these the latter was a poor
man, but excellent in breeding and in character; Parmenides so
loved him and respected him that, when he died, he dedicated a
hero's chapel to his memory. The philosophers of this period i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>n
Greece, as might be proved abundantly, were no mere students
but men of action and political importance. Their reputation
for superior wisdom caused them to be consulted in affairs of
state, and to be deferred to in matters of constitutional legislation.
Some of them, like Thales, Anaximander, and Empedocles,
were employed on works of public utility. Others, like Pythagoras,
remodelled the society of cities, or, like Anaxagoras, through
their influence with public men like Pericles, raised the tone of
politics around them. All of them devoted a large portion of
their time and attention to the study of public questions. It was
this kind of prestige, we may conjecture, which, in the next phase
of Greek thought, threw so much power into the hands of sophists,
and which finally encouraged Plato in his theory that those
states would be best governed where the sages were the rulers.</p>

<p>Of Parmenides himself some precious notices have been preserved
by Plato. It appears that the great Eleatic teacher visited
Athens in his old age. Socrates was a young man at the period
of this visit; and Plato, whether inventing an occasion for
their meeting or relying on actual tradition, brings them into conversation.
In the prelude to the dialogue <i>Parmenides</i>, we read:<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He told us that Pythodorus had described to him the appearance of Parmenides
and Zeno; they came to Athens, he said, at the great Panathen&aelig;a;
the former was, at the time of his visit, about sixty-five years old, very white
with age, but well-favored. Zeno was nearly forty years of age, of a noble
figure and fair aspect; and in the days of his youth he was reported to have
been beloved of Parmenides. He said that they lodged with Pythodorus in
the Ceramicus, outside the wall, whither Socrates and others came to see
them; they wanted to hear some writings of Zeno, which had been brought
to Athens by them for the first time. He said that Socrates was then very
young, and that Zeno read them to him in the absence of Parmenides, and
had nearly finished when Pythodorus entered, and with him Parmenides and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>Aristoteles, who was afterwards one of the Thirty; there was not much more
to hear, and Pythodorus had heard Zeno repeat them before."</p></div>

<p>The <i>The&aelig;tetus</i> contains another allusion to Parmenides, which
proves in what reverence the old philosopher was held by Socrates:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My reason is that I have a kind of reverence, not so much for Melissus
and the others, who say that 'all is one and at rest,' as for the great leader
himself, Parmenides, venerable and awful, as in Homeric language he may be
called&mdash;him I should be ashamed to approach in a spirit unworthy of him. I
met him when he was an old man and I was a mere youth, and he appeared
to me to have a glorious depth of mind. And I am afraid that we may not
understand his language, and may fall short even more of his meaning."</p></div>

<p>Finally, in the <i>Sophistes</i> a passing allusion to the same event is
put into the mouth of Socrates: "I remember hearing Parmenides
use the latter of the two methods, when I was a young man
and he was far advanced in years, in a very noble discussion."
These notices of the Eleatic sage, we feel, are not in any sense
accidental. Plato has introduced them in important moments of
his three most studied dialogues upon those very points which occupied
the mind of Parmenides, and by the elaboration of which
he made his greatest contribution to philosophy. The problems
of knowledge and of the relation of the phenomenal universe to
real existence were for the first time methodically treated in the
school of Elea. Their solution in the theory of Ideas was the
main object of Plato's philosophical activity.</p>

<p>The unity asserted by Xenophanes gave its motto to the Eleatic
school; &#7955;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945; became their watchword. Parmenides,
however, abstracted from this unity all theological attributes.
Plain existence, obtained apparently by divesting thought of all
qualifications derived from sensation and imagination, and regarding
it in primitive and abstract nakedness or nothingness, was the
only positive condition which he left to the principle of Bein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>g;
and though he seems to have identified this Being with Thought,
we must be careful not to be misled by modern analogies into
fancying that his &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053; involved a purely intellectual idealism.
Nor, again, can we regard it as the totality of things presented to
the senses; the most earnest polemic of the philosopher is directed
against this view. The Unity, the Being, of Parmenides, was
in truth the barest metaphysical abstraction, deduced, we are
tempted to believe, in the first instance from a simple observation
of language, and yet, when formed, not wholly purged from
corporeity. Being is proved by the word &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;. The singular
number indicates the unity of the subject; the present tense
proves its eternity, for it neither asserts a <i>has been</i> nor a <i>will be</i>,
but an everlasting <i>is</i>. Its antithesis not-Being is impossible and
inconceivable; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;. Completing his conception of Being as
the sole reality, and carrying out the arguments attributed by Aristotle
to his master,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Parmenides shows that the eternal One is
indivisible, immovable, continuous, homogeneous, absolutely self-identical,
beyond the reach of birth, or change, or dissolution.
Furthermore, it is finite and spheroid. In rounding and completing
his notion of the Unity of Being, Parmenides seems at
this point to have passed into the region of geometrical abstractions.
The sphere of mathematics requires to be circumscribed
by a superficies equidistant at all points from the centre. These
conditions of perfection Parmenides attributed to Being, forgetting
that the finite sphere thus conceived by him implied, by a
necessity of human thought, a beyond against which it should be
defined. At the same time, this geometrical analogy prevents
us from assuming that the further identification of Being with
Thought excluded a concrete and almost material conception of
the Ens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>As opposed to this unique &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;, the sole and universal reality,
which can only be apprehended by the reason, and which is eternally
and continuously One, Parmenides places the totality of
phenomena, multiplex, diverse, subject to birth, change, division,
dissolution, motion. These, he asserts, are non-existent, the illusions
of the senses, mere names, the vague and unreal dreamworld
of impotent mortals. Not having advanced in his analysis
of thought beyond the first category of Being, he felt obliged to
abandon the multiplicity of things as hopeless and unthinkable.
Yet he cannot deny their phenomenal existence; there they are,
deceiving the sage and the simple man alike: experience asserts
them; language and the opinion of humanity take them for granted
as realities. Parmenides feels bound to offer an explanation
of this cosmos of illusion, this many-formed and many-colored
mirage. His teaching consequently contains a paradox deeply
embedded in its very substance. Having first expounded the law
of absolute truth, he proceeds to render a grave and meditated
account of error. Having demonstrated the sole existence of abstract
Being, he turns a page and begins to discourse, like any
physicist of his age in Greece, concerning Light and Night, Hot
and Cold, Fire and Earth, Active and Passive, Male and Female,
Rare and Dense. By a singular irony of fate it was precisely for
this portion of his teaching that he received the praise of Bacon
in the <i>Novum Organum</i>. To connect the doctrine of Being, &#964;&#8048;
&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#8053;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;, and the doctrine of Appearance, &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#948;&#8057;&#958;&#945;&#957;, was
beyond his power. It was what Plato afterwards attempted in
his theory of ideas, and Aristotle in the theory of forms and
matter, &#949;&#7988;&#948;&#951; and &#8021;&#955;&#951;. Parmenides himself seems to have regarded
man as a part of the cosmos, subject to its phantasmagoric
changes and illusions, yet capable of comprehending that, while
the substratum of Being is alone immutable, real, and one, all else
is shifting, non-existent, and many. Neglect, he says, the object
of sense, the plurality of things obedient to change, and you wil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>l
arrive at the object of reason, the unity that alters not and can be
only apprehended by thought. Yet, while on the one hand he
did not disdain to theorize the universe of sense, so, on the other
hand, as already hinted, he had not arrived at the point of abstracting
corporeity from Being. To do this from his point of
view was indeed impossible. Having posited pure Being as the
sole reality, he was obliged to form a figurative presentation of it
to his own mind. A new stage had to be accomplished by human
thought before the intellect could fairly grapple with the
problems nakedly and paradoxically propounded by the sage of
Elea.</p>

<p>From the immense importance attached by Parmenides to the
verb &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;, and from his assertion that men deal with names and
not with realities, it followed that to his metaphysical teaching a
logical set of corollaries had to be appended. To construct these
was the task of Zeno, his beloved pupil and authorized successor.
Zeno undertook to maintain the Parmenidean Unity, both against
the vulgar evidence of the senses and also against philosophers
who, like Heraclitus, directed their attention to the flux and multiplicity
of things. His method was, not to prove the necessity
of unity at rest, but to demonstrate the contradictions involved
in the ideas of plurality and motion. The intellectual difficulties
implied in the divisibility of time and space and matter were developed
by Zeno with a force and subtlety that justified Aristotle
in calling him the founder of dialectic. His logic, however, was
but the expansion of positions implicit in Xenophanes and clearly
indicated by Parmenides. How the Eleatic arguments, as further
handled by Melissus, helped the Sophists, and influenced the school
of Megara, who went so far as to refuse any but identical propositions,
are matters that belong to another chapter of Greek history.
So, too, is Plato's attempt to resolve the antinomies revealed
in human thought by the polemic of his predecessors. Enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
has now been said to serve as preface to the following version of
the fragments of Parmenides.</p>

<p>His poem&mdash;for, strange as it must always seem, Parmenides
committed the exposition of his austerely abstract and argumentative
doctrine to hexameters&mdash;begins with an epical allegory.
He feigns to have been drawn by horses on a chariot to the
house of Truth: the horses may, perhaps, be taken, as in Plato's
vision of the <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i>, to symbolize faculties of the soul; and the
gates of Truth open upon two roads&mdash;one called the way of night,
or error; the other, of light, or real knowledge. The goddess
who dwells here, divine Sophia, instructs him equally in the lore
of truth and of opinion, and makes no attempt, as will be seen
from her own words, to conceal the futility of the second part of
her discourse. From a literary point of view the poem has no
merit. Even the exordium is stiff and tame. It begins thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The steeds which bear me, and have brought me to the bounds of my
desire, since they drew and carried me into the way renowned of her who
leads the wise man to all knowledge&mdash;on that road I journeyed, on that road
they bore me, those steeds of thought that whirl the car along. But maidens
showed the way, sun-born maids, who left the halls of gloom and brought us
to the light, withdrawing with their fingers from their brows the veils. And
the axle in the socket made a whistling sound, glowing as by two round
wheels on either side it ran, while the steeds drove the car swiftly on. There
are the gates which open on the paths of Night and Day. A lintel shuts
them in above, and a floor of stone beneath; but the airy space they close is
fastened with huge doors, which Justice the avenger locks or unlocks by the
key she holds. Her did the maidens sue with gentle words, and wisely won
her to draw for them the bolted barrier from the gates. The gates flew
open, and the doors yawned wide, back rolling in the sockets their brazen
hinges wrought with clasps and nails. Straight through the portal drove the
maidens car and horses on the broad highway. And me the goddess graciously
received; she took my right hand in her hand, and spoke these words,
addressing me: 'Child of man, companion of immortal charioteers, that comest
drawn by horses to our home, welcome! for thee no evil fate sent forth to tr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>avel
on this path&mdash;far from the track of men indeed it lies&mdash;but Right and Justice
were thy guides. Thy lot it is all things to learn; both the sure heart
of truth that wins assent, and the vain fancies of mortals which have no real
ground of faith. Yet these, too, shalt thou learn, since it behooves thee to
know all opinions, testing them, and travelling every field of thought.'"</p></div>

<p>Here the exordium, as we possess it, ends, and we start upon the
fragments of the lecture addressed by divine Sophia to the mortal
sage. The order and the connection of these fragments are
more than doubtful. So much, however, is clear, that they fall
into two sections&mdash;the first treating of scientific truth, the second
of popular opinion. The instrument of knowledge in the one
case is the reason; in the other the senses bear confused and untrustworthy
witness to phenomena.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Come now, for I will tell, and do thou hear and keep my words, what are
the only ways of inquiry that lead to knowledge. The one which certifies
that being is, and that not-being is not, is the pathway of persuasion, for
truth follows it. The other, which declares that being is not, and that not-being
must be, that I affirm is wholly unpersuasive; for neither couldst thou
know not-being, since it cannot be got at, nor couldst thou utter it in words,
seeing that thought and being are the same.</p>

<p>"To me it is indifferent where I begin, for again to the same point I
shall return. It must be that speech and thought are being, for being is,
and that not-being is nothing: which things I bid thee ponder. First, keep
thy mind from that path of inquiry, then, too, from that on which mortals
who know nothing wander in doubt; helplessness sways in their breasts the
erring mind; hither and thither are they borne, deaf, yea, and blind, in wonderment,
confused crowds who fancy being and not-being are the same and
not the same; the way of all of them leads backwards."</p></div>

<p>Some light is thrown upon these fragments by a passage in the
<i>Sophistes</i> of Plato, where the Eleatic stranger is made to say: "In
the days when I was a boy, the great Parmenides protested against
this (<i>i.e.</i>, against asserting the existence of not-being), and to the
end of his life he continued to inculcate the same lesson&mdash;always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
repeating, both in verse and out of verse, <i>Keep your mind from
this way of inquiry, for never will you show that not-being is.</i>"
The fragment which immediately follows, if we are right in assuming
the continuity and order of its verses, forms the longest
portion of the poem extant.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Never do thou learn to fancy that things that are not, are; but keep thy
mind from this path of inquiry; nor let custom force thee to pursue that
beaten way, to use blind eyes and sounding ear and tongue, but judge by reason
the knotty argument which I declare. One only way of reasoning is left&mdash;that
being is. Wherein are many signs that it is uncreate and indestructible,
whole in itself, unique in kind, immovable and everlasting. It never
was, nor will be, since it exists as a simultaneous present, a continuous unity.
What origin shall we seek of it? Where and how did it grow? That it
arose from not-being I will not suffer thee to say or think, for it cannot be
thought or said that being is not. Then, too, what necessity could have
forced it to the birth at an earlier or later moment? for neither birth nor
beginning belongs to being. Wherefore either to be or not to be is the unconditioned
alternative. Nor will the might of proof allow us to believe that
anything can spring from being but itself. Therefore the law of truth permits
no birth or dissolution in it, no remission of its chains, but holds it firm.
This, then, is the point for decision: it is, or it is not. Now we have settled,
as necessity obliged, to leave the one path, inconceivable, unnamed, for it is
not the true way; but to affirm, as sure, that being is. How then could being
have a future or a past? If it began to be, or if it is going to be, then it is
not: wherefore birth and death are alike put aside as inconceivable. Nor is
it divisible, since it is all homogeneous, in no part more itself than in another,
which would prevent its coherence, nor in any part less; but all is full of
being. Wherefore it is one continuous whole, for being draws to being. Immovable
within the bounds of its great chains it is, without beginning, without
end, since birth and dissolution have moved far away, whom certainty repelled.
Eternally the same, in the same state, for and by itself, it abides;
thus fixed and firm it stays, for strong necessity holds it in the chains of limit
and clinches it around. Wherefore being cannot be infinite, seeing it lacks
nothing; and if it were, it would lack all.</p>

<p>"Look now at things which, though absent, are present to the mind. For
never shall being from being be sundered so as to lose its continuity <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>by dispersion
or recombination.</p>

<p>"Thought and the object of thought are the same, for without being, in
which is affirmation, thou wilt not find thought. For nothing is or will be
besides being, since fate hath bound it to remain alone and unmoved, which
is named the universe&mdash;all things that mortal men held fixed, believing in their
truth&mdash;birth and death, to be and not to be, change of place, and variety of
color.</p>

<p>"Now since the extreme limit of being is defined, the whole is like a well-rounded
sphere, of equal radius in all directions, for it may not be less or
greater in one part or another. For neither is there not-being to prevent its
attaining to equality, nor is it possible that being should in one place be more
and in another less than being, since all is inviolably one. For this is certain,
that it abides, an equal whole all round, within its limits.</p>

<p>"Here, then, I conclude my true discourse and meditation upon Truth.
Turn now and learn the opinions of men listening to the deceptive order of
my words."</p></div>

<p>The divine Sophia calls the speech which she is about to utter
deceptive (&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#955;&#8057;&#957;), because it has to do no longer with the
immutable and imperturbable laws of entity, but only with the
delusions to which the human mind is exposed by the evidence
of the senses. If Parmenides had been in any true sense of the
word a poet, he would not have subjected Sophia to the ridicule
of condemning her own observations, when he might have invented
some other machinery for the conveyance of his physical hypothesis.
Nothing, in fact, can be more artistically monstrous
than to put lies into the mouth of Truth personified. The fragments
of this portion of his poem may, in spite of their scientific
worthlessness, be translated, if only for the sake of completeness.
We must suppose, therefore, that Wisdom has resumed her parable,
and is speaking as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Two forms have they determined by their minds to name, for those are
wrong who take but one of these. Corporeally and by signs they have distinguished
them, setting on the one side fire, ethereal, gentle, very subtle,
everywhere identical, but different from the other element. That, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>too, is self-identical,
diverse from fire, dark night, a thick and weighty body. Of these I
will reveal to you the whole disposition, as it appears, so that no thought of
mortals may ever elude you.</p>

<p>"Now, seeing that all things are called by the name of light and night, and
the qualities that severally pertain to them, the universe is full of light and
murky night, rivals equally balanced, since neither partakes of the other.</p>

<p>"For the narrower spheres have been fashioned of impure fire; those next
of night, interpenetrated by a portion of flame; and in the midst of all is the
goddess who controls the whole. For everywhere she is the cause of dire
parturition and procreation, making female mix with male, and male with female."</p></div>

<p>At this point in the murky exposition there shines forth a single
line, which, seized upon by poets and poetic souls in after-years,
traverses the dismal waste of false physics and imperfect
metaphysics like a streak of inspiration&mdash;"fair as a star when
only one is shining in the sky."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Love, first of all the gods, she formed."</p>

<p>"Thou, too, shalt know the nature of ether, and in ether all the signs, and
the hidden acts of the bright sun's pure lamp, and whence they sprang; and
thou shalt learn the revolutions of the round-eyed moon, and whence she is;
and thou shalt understand the all-surrounding heaven, whence it arose, and
how fate ruling it bound it to keep the limits of the stars.</p>

<p>"How earth and sun and moon and ether shared by all, and the galaxy and
farthest Olympus, and the hot might of stars sprang into being.</p>

<p>"Another light that shines in revolution round the earth by night.</p>

<p>"Forever gazing at the radiant sun.</p>

<p>"For as the elements are mixed in the jointed framework of our limbs, so
are the minds of men made up. For the nature of the members is the same
as that which thinks in the case of all and each; it is mind that rules.</p>

<p>"From the right side boys, from the left girls.</p>

<p>"Thus, according to opinion, were born and now are these things; and
afterwards, when they have grown to the full, will perish: whereto men have
affixed unto each a name."</p></div>

<p>It is only by a complete translation of the extant fragments of
Parmenides that any notion can be formed of the hiatus between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
what he chose to call truth and what he termed opinion. As a
thinker, he revealed both the weakness of his metaphysical system
and the sincerity of his intention by proclaiming this abrupt
division between the realm of the pure reason and the field of the
senses, without attempting a synthesis. No other speculator has
betrayed the vanity of dogmatism about the absolute more conclusively
by the simultaneous presentation of lame guesses in the
region of the relative. The impartial student of his verse is
forced to the conclusion that the titles &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#8053;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957; and &#964;&#8048;
&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#948;&#8057;&#958;&#945;&#957;, which have been given to the two departments of his
exposition, are both arbitrary; for what warrant have we that his
intuitions into the nature of pure being are more certain than his
guesses about the conditions of phenomenal existence? Parmenides
might, indeed, be selected as a parable of the human mind
pretending to a knowledge of the unconditioned truth, and, after
all, arriving at nothing more cogent than opinion. The innumerable
ontological assertions which in the pride of the speculative
reason have been made by men are &#948;&#8057;&#958;&#945;&#953;; and the epigram pointed
by Parmenides against the common folk is equally applicable
to his own sect&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#922;&#969;&#966;&#959;&#8054; &#8001;&#956;&#8182;&#962; &#964;&#965;&#966;&#955;&#959;&#8055; &#964;&#949;, &#964;&#949;&#952;&#951;&#960;&#8057;&#964;&#949;&#962;, &#7940;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#945; &#966;&#8166;&#955;&#945;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As soon as men begin to dogmatize, whether the supposed truth
to which they pin their faith be the barest metaphysical abstraction
or some assumed intuition into the divine nature, they create
a schism between the multiplicity of the universe and the unity
which they proclaim. In other words, they distinguish, like Parmenides,
between what they arbitrarily denote as truth and what
they cannot account for as phenomena. To quit the sphere of
our own mind is impossible; and, therefore, nothing can be discovered
which is not some mode of the mind. The utmost the
metaphysician can do is to describe the operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> of the human
intellect without explaining its existence, and all systematized
knowledge is but a classification of the categories of consciousness.
Thus the sophistic position that man is for man the measure
of all things is irrefutable. But when he attempts to hypostasize
his own thoughts as realities, to argue outward from his
conceptions to the universe, this is the same as taking a leap
in the dark across an undefined abyss from the only ascertained
standing-ground to a hypothetical beyond.</p>

<p>During the two-and-twenty centuries which have elapsed since
the days of Parmenides, the philosophers have learned wisdom.
They are now too wary to parade the distinction between two
kinds of opinion, and to construct one system of truth, another
of illusion. They either content themselves with omitting what
they regard as the insoluble, or they endeavor to invent an all-embracing
schema, which shall supersede the cruder distinctions
between subject and object, mind and nature, ego and non-ego.
Yet nothing in the realm of absolute knowledge has been gained
in all this space of time.</p>

<p>The owl of Minerva, to quote one of Hegel's most luminous
epigrams, still starts upon its flight when the evening twilight,
succeeding the day of work, has fallen. Metaphysic goes on
shaping from the human consciousness a fabric which it calls
reality. Science has magnified and multiplied phenomena until,
instead of one, we have in every case a million problems to employ
intelligence. Social conditions grow more complex, and more
and more is ascertained about the inner life of man. But the
fact remains that, while theologian, logician, physicist, and moralist,
each from his own standing-point, may cry "Eureka!" we can
know nothing in itself. The most complicated system, created
by the Aristotle of the modern world, involves at the outset an
assumption. From reflection on the laws of human thought, on
the varied acquisitions of the human mind, and on the succes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>sive
phases of human history, it carries over the synthetic statement
of its conclusions to the account of the universe. In other words,
it postulates the identity of the human and the divine mind, and
ends by asserting that thought is the only reality. Does not a
fallacy lie in this, that while the mind possesses the faculty of
reflecting upon itself, everything which it knows is of necessity
expressed in terms of itself, and therefore in pretending to give
an account of the universe it is only giving an account of its own
operations? The philosophy of the <i>Id&eacute;e</i> is thus a way of looking
at things; to explain them or deduce them is beyond its
reach. How, for example, except by exercise of faith, by dogmatism
and initial begging of the question, can we be assured that
an intelligence differently constituted from the human mind
should not cognize a different &#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#8057;&#962;, or intelligible world,
and be equally justified in claiming to have arrived at truth? It
is comparatively easy to acquire encyclop&aelig;dic knowledge, to construct
a system, to call the keystone of the system the <i>Id&eacute;e</i>, and
to assert that the <i>Id&eacute;e</i> is God. But is all this of any value except
as a machine for arranging and formulating thoughts and opinions?
At the end of philosophies one feels tempted to exclaim:</p>

<p>The figure of Empedocles of Agrigentum, when seen across the
twenty-three centuries which separate us from him, presents perhaps
a more romantic appearance than that of any other Greek
philosopher. This is owing, in a great measure, to the fables
which invest his life and death with mystery, to his reputation
for magical power, and to the wild sublimity of some of his poetic
utterances. Yet, even in his lifetime, and among contemporary
Greeks, he swept the stage of life like a great tragic actor, and
left to posterity the fame of genius as a poet, a physician, a patriot,
and a philosopher. The well-known verses of Lucretius are
enough to prove that the glory of Empedocles increased with age,
and bore the test of time. Reading them, we cannot but regret
that poems which so stirred the reverent enthusiasm of Rome's
greatest singer have been scattered to the winds, and that what
we now possess of their remains affords but a poor sample of
their unimpaired magnificence.</p>

<p>Nothing is more remarkable about Empedocles than his versatility
and comprehensiveness. Other men of his age were as
nobly born, as great in philosophic power, as disti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>nguished for
the part they bore in politics, as celebrated for poetic genius, as
versed in mystic lore, in medicine, and in magic arts. But Parmenides,
Pythagoras, Pausanias, and Epimenides could claim honor
in but one, or two at most, of these departments. Empedocles
united all, and that too, if we may judge by the temper of his
genius and the few legends handed down to us about his life, in
no ordinary degree. He seems to have possessed a warmth and
richness of nature which inclined him to mysticism and poetry,
and gave a tone of peculiar solemnity to everything he did or
thought or said. At the same time, he was attracted by the
acuteness of his intellect to the metaphysical inquiries which were
agitating the western colonies of Greece, while his rare powers of
observation enabled him to make discoveries in the then almost
unexplored region of natural science. The age in which he lived
had not yet thrown off the form of poetry in philosophical composition.
Even Parmenides had committed his austere theories
to hexameter verse. Therefore, the sage of Agrigentum was easily
led to concentrate his splendid powers on the production of one
great work, and made himself a poet among philosophers, and a
philosopher among poets, without thereby impairing his claims to
rank highly both as a poet and also as a thinker among the most
distinguished men of Greece. But Empedocles had not only
deeply studied metaphysics, nature, and the arts of verse; whatever
was mysterious in the world around him, in the guesses of
past ages, and in the forebodings of his own heart, possessed a
powerful attraction for the man who thought himself inspired of
God. Having embraced the Pythagorean theories, he maintained
the fallen state of men, and implored his fellow-creatures to
purge away the guilt by which they had been disinherited and
exiled from the joys of heaven. Thus he appeared before his
countrymen not only as a poet and philosopher, but also as a
priest and purifier. Born of a wealthy and illustrious house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>, he
did not expend his substance merely on horse-racing and chariots,
by which means of display his ancestors had gained a princely
fame in Sicily; but, not less proud than they had been, he shod
himself with golden sandals, set the laurel crown upon his head,
and, trailing robes of Tyrian purple through the streets of Agrigentum,
went attended by a crowd of serving-men and reverent
admirers. He claimed to be a favorite of Ph&#339;bus, and rose at
length to the pretension of divinity. His own words show this,
gravely spoken, with no vain assumption, but with a certainty of
honor well deserved:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Friends who dwell in the great city hard by the yellow stream of Acragas,
who live on the Acropolis, intent on honorable cares, harbors revered of strangers,
ignorant of what is vile, welcome; but I appear before you an immortal
god, having overpassed the limits of mortality, and walk with honor among
all, as is my due, crowned with long fillets and luxuriant garlands. No sooner
do I enter their proud prosperous cities than men and women pay me reverence,
who follow me in thousands, asking the way to profit, some desiring
oracles, and others racked by long and cruel torments, hanging on my lips to
hear the spells that pacify disease of every kind."</p></div>

<p>We can hardly wonder that some of the fellow-citizens of Empedocles
were jealous of his pretensions, and regarded him with
suspicious envy and dislike, when we read such lines of lofty self-exaltation.
Indeed, it is difficult for men of the nineteenth century
to understand how a great and wise philosopher could lay
claim to divine honors in his own lifetime. This arrogance we
have been accustomed to associate with the names of a Caligula
and a Claudius. Yet when we consider the circumstances in
which Empedocles was placed, and the nature of his theories, our
astonishment diminishes. The line of demarcation between this
world and the supernatural was then but vague and undetermined.
Popular theology abounded in legends of gods who had held familiar
intercourse with men, and of men who had been raised by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
prowess or wisdom to divinity. The pedigrees of all distinguished
families ended in a god at no great distance. Nor was it then
a mere figure of speech when bards and priests claimed special
revelations from Apollo, or physicians styled themselves the children
of Asclepius. Heaven lay around the first Greeks in their
infancy of art and science; it was long before the vision died
away and faded into the sober daylight of Aristotelian philosophy.
Thus when Empedocles proclaimed himself a god, he only
stretched beyond the usual limit a most common pretension of
all men learned in arts and sciences. His own speculations gave
him further warrant for the assumption of the style of deity; for
he held the belief that all living souls had once been d&aelig;mons or
divine spirits, who had lost their heavenly birthright for some
crime of impurity or violence, and yet were able to restore themselves
to pristine splendor by the rigorous exercise of abstinence
and expiatory rites. These rites he thought he had discovered.
He had prayed and fasted; he had held communion with Ph&#339;bus
the purifier, and received the special favor of that god, by
being made a master in the arts of song and magic and healing
and priestcraft. Was he not, therefore, justified in saying that
he had won again his rights divine, and transformed himself
into a god on earth? His own words tell the history of his fall:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Woe to me that I did not fall a prey to death before I took the cursed
food within my lips!... From what glory, from what immeasurable bliss,
have I now sunk to roam with mortals on this earth?"</p></div>

<p>Again, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For I have been in by-gone times a youth, a maiden, and a flowering shrub,
a bird, yea, and a fish that swims in silence the deep sea."</p></div>

<p>From this degraded state the spirit gradually emerges. Of the
noblest souls he says:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Among beasts they become lions dwelling in caverns of the earth upon
the hills, and laurels among leafy trees, ... and at last prophets and bards
and physicians and chiefs among the men of earth, from whence they rise to
be gods supreme in honor, ... sitting at banquets with immortal comrades,
in their feasts unvisited by human cares, beyond the reach of fate and wearing
age."</p></div>

<p>Empedocles, by dint of pondering on nature, by long penance,
by the illumination of his intellect and the coercion of his senses,
had been raised before the natural term of life to that high honor,
and been made the fellow of immortal gods. His language upon
this topic is one of the points in which we can trace an indistinct
resemblance between him and some of the Indian mystics. There
is, however, no reason to suppose that Asiatic thought had any
marked or direct influence on Greek philosophy. It is better to
refer such similarities to the working of the same tendencies in
the Greek and Hindoo minds.</p>

<p>To those who disbelieved his words he showed the mighty
works which he had wrought. Empedocles, during his lifetime,
was known to have achieved marvels, such as only supernatural
powers could compass. More than common sagacity and ingenuity
in the treatment of natural diseases, or in the removal of
obstacles to national prosperity, were easily regarded by the simple
people of those times as the evidence of divine authority.
Empedocles had devised means for protecting the citizens of
Agrigentum from the fury of destructive winds. What these
means were, we do not know; but he received in consequence the
title of &#954;&#969;&#955;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#8051;&#956;&#945;&#962;, or warder-off of winds. Again, he resuscitated,
from the very jaws of death, a woman who lay senseless
and unable to breathe, long after all physicians had despaired of
curing her. This entitled him to be regarded as a master of the
keys of life and death; nor did he fail to attribute his own power
to the virtue of supernatural spells. But the greatest of his
achievements was the deliverance which he wrought for the peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>ple
of Selinus from a grievous pestilence. It seems that, some
exhalations from a marsh having caused this plague, Empedocles,
at his own cost, cut a channel for two rivers through the fen, and
purged away the fetid vapors. A short time after the cessation
of the sickness, Empedocles, attired in tragic state, appeared before
the Selinuntians at a banquet. His tall and stately figure
wore the priestly robe; his brazen sandals rang upon the marble
as he slowly moved with front benign and solemn eyes; beneath
the sacrificial chaplet flowed his long Ph&#339;bean locks, and in his
hand he bore a branch of bay. The nobles of Selinus rose; the
banquet ceased; all did him reverence, and hailed him as a god,
deliverer of their city, friend of Ph&#339;bus, intercessor between angry
heaven and suffering men.</p>

<p>Closely connected with his claim to divinity was the position
which Empedocles assumed as an enchanter. Gorgias, his pupil,
asserts that he often saw him at the magic rites. Nor are we to
suppose that this wizardry was a popular misinterpretation of his
real power as a physician and philosopher. It is far more probable
that Empedocles himself believed in the potency of incantations,
and delighted in the ceremonies and mysterious songs by
which the dead were recalled from Hades, and secrets of the other
world wrung from unwilling fate. We can form to ourselves
a picture of this stately and magnificent enchanter, convinced of
his own supernatural ascendency, and animated by the wild enthusiasm
of his ardent nature, alone among the mountains of Girgenti,
or by the sea-shore, invoking the elemental deities to aid
his incantations, and ascribing the forebodings of his own poetic
spirit to external inspiration or the voice of gods. In solitary
meditations he had wrought out a theory of the world, and had
conceived the notion of a spiritual God, one and unseen, pure intellect,
an everlasting omnipresent power, to whom might be referred
those natural remedies that stopped the plague, or cu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>red
the sick, or found new channels for the streams. The early Greek
philosophers were fond of attributing to some "common wisdom"
of the world, some animating soul or universal intellect,
the arts and intuitions to which they had themselves attained.
Therefore, with this belief predominating in his mind, it is not
strange that he should have trusted to the divine efficacy of his
own spells, and have regarded the results of observation as a kind
of supernatural wisdom. To his friend Pausanias the physician
he makes these lofty promises, "Thou shalt learn every kind of
medicines that avert diseases and the evils of old age. Thou too
shalt curb the fury of untiring winds, and when it pleases thee
thou shalt reverse thy charms and loose avenging storms. Thou
shalt replace black rain-clouds with the timely drought that men
desire, and when the summer's arid heat prevails, thou shalt refresh
the trees with showers that rustle in the thirsty corn. And
thou shalt bring again from Hades the life of a departed man."
Like the Pythagoreans whom he followed, he seems to have employed
the fascination of music in effecting cures: it is recorded
of him that he once arrested the hand of a young man about to
slay his father, by chanting to the lyre a solemn soul-subduing
strain. The strong belief in himself which Empedocles possessed
inspired him with immense personal influence, so that his looks
and words and tones went further than the force of other men.
He compelled them to follow and confide in him, like Orpheus,
or like those lofty natures which in every age have had the power
of leading and controlling others by innate supremacy. That
Empedocles tried to exhibit this superiority, and to heighten its
effect by gorgeous raiment and profuse expenditure, by public
ceremonies and mysterious modes of life, we need not doubt.
There was much of the spirit of Paracelsus in Empedocles, and
vanity impaired the simple grandeur of his genius. In every age
of the world's history there have been some such men&mdash;men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
whom the highest intellectual gifts are blended with weakness inclining
them to superstitious juggleries. Not content with their
philosophical pretensions, or with poetical renown, they seek a
more mysterious fame, and mix the pure gold of their reason with
the dross of idle fancy. Their very weakness adds a glow of
color, which we miss in the whiter light of more purely scientific
intellects. They are men in whom two natures cross&mdash;the poet
and the philosopher, the mountebank and the seer, the divine and
the fortune-teller, the rigorous analyst and the retailer of old wives'
tales. But none have equalled Empedocles, in whose capacious
idiosyncrasy the most opposite qualities found ample room for coexistence,
who sincerely claimed the supernatural faculties which
Paracelsus must have only half believed, and who lived at a time
when poetry and fact were indistinguishably mingled, and when
the world was still absorbed in dreams of a past golden age, and
in rich foreshadowings of a boundless future.</p>

<p>We are not, therefore, surprised to read the fantastic legends
which involve his death in a mystery. Whatever ground of fact
they may possess, they are wholly consistent with the picture we
have formed to ourselves of the philosopher, and prove at least
the superstition which had gathered round his name. One of
these legends has served all ages as a moral for the futility of human
designs, and for the just reward of inordinate vanity. Every
one who knows the name of Empedocles has heard that, having
jumped into Etna in order to conceal the time and manner of his
death, and thus to establish his divinity, fate frustrated his schemes
by casting up his brazen slippers on the crater's edge. According
to another legend, which resembles that of the death of Romulus,
of &#338;dipus, and other divinized heroes, Empedocles is related to
have formed one of a party of eighty men who assembled to
celebrate by sacrifice his restoration of the dying woman. After
their banquet they retired to sleep. But Empedocles remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in his seat at table. When morning broke, Empedocles was nowhere
to be found. In reply to the question of his friends, some
one asserted that he had heard a loud voice calling on Empedocles
at midnight, and that, starting up, he saw a light from heaven and
burning torches. Pausanias, who was present at the sacrificial
feast, sent far and wide to inquire for his friend, wishing to test
the truth of this report. But piety restrained his search, and he
was secretly informed by heavenly messengers that Empedocles
had won what he had sought, and that divine honors should be
paid to him. This story rests on the authority of Heraclides
Ponticus, who professed to have obtained it from Pausanias. The
one legend we may regard as the coinage of his foes, the other as
a myth created by the superstitious admiration of his friends.</p>

<p>We have hitherto regarded Empedocles more in his private and
priestly character than as a citizen. Yet it was not to be expected
that a man so nobly born, and so remarkable for intellectual
power, should play no public part in his native state. A Greek
could hardly avoid meddling with politics, even if he wished to do
so, and Empedocles was not one to hide his genius in the comparative
obscurity of private life. While he was still a young
man, Theron, the wise tyrant of Agrigentum, died, and a powerful
aristocracy endeavored to enslave the state. Empedocles manfully
resisted them, supporting the liberal cause with vehemence, and
winning so much popular applause that he is even reported to
have received and refused the offer of the kingly power. By
these means he made himself many foes among the nobility of
Agrigentum; it is also probable that suspicion attached to him
for trying to establish in his native city the Pythagorean commonwealth,
which had been extirpated in South Italy. That he
loved spiritual dominion we have seen; and this he might have
hoped to acquire more easily by taking the intellectual lead

the aristocratic party, or by exposing himself to the dangers and
absorbing cares of a Greek tyrant. At any rate, it is recorded
that he impeached and procured the execution of the leaders of
the aristocracy; thus rescuing the liberty of his nation at the expense
of his own security. After a visit to Peloponnesus, Empedocles
returned to Agrigentum, but was soon obliged to quit his
home again by the animosity of his political enemies. Where he
spent the last years of his life, and died, remains uncertain.</p>

<p>It remains to estimate the poetical and philosophical renown
of Empedocles. That his genius was highly valued among the
ancients appears manifest from the panegyric of Lucretius. Nor
did he fail to exhibit the versatility of his powers in every branch
of poetical composition. Diogenes Laertius affirms that forty-three
tragedies bearing his name were known to Hieronymus,
from whom he drew materials for the life of Empedocles. Whether
these tragedies were really written by the philosopher or by
another Sicilian of the same name admits of doubt. But there
is no reason why an author possessed of such varied and distinguished
talents as Empedocles should not have tried this species
of composition. Xenophanes is said to have composed tragedies;
and Plato's youthful efforts would, we fondly imagine, have afforded
the world fresh proofs of his commanding genius, had they
escaped the flames to which they were condemned by his maturer
judgment. No fragments of the tragedies of Empedocles survive;
they probably belonged to the class of semi-dithyrambic compositions
which prevailed at Athens before the days of &AElig;schylus,
and which continued to be cultivated in Sicily. Some of the lyrical
plays of the Italians&mdash;such, for instance, as the <i>Orfeo</i> of Poliziano&mdash;may
enable us to form an idea of these simple dramas.
After the tragedies, Diogenes makes mention of political poems.
These may be referred to the period of the early manhood of Empedocles,
when he was engaged in combat with the domineering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
aristocracy, and when he might have sought to spread his liberal
principles through the medium of gnomic elegies, like those of
Solon or Theognis. The fragments of the &#954;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#8055;, or poem on
lustral rites, sufficiently display his style of earnest and imperious
exhortation to make us believe that at a time of political contention
he would not spare this powerful instrument of persuasion
and attack. In the next place, we hear of an epic poem on the
invasion of Greece by Xerxes, which Empedocles is said to have
left unfinished, and which his sister or his daughter burned with
other papers at his death. The great defeat of the Medes took
place while Empedocles was still a youth. All Hellas had hung
with breathless expectation on the events of Marathon and Salamis.
The fall of Xerxes brought freedom and relief from terrible anxiety,
not only to the towns of Attica and the Peloponnesus, but
also to the shores of Sicily and Italy. It is not, therefore, unlikely
that the triumph which excited Simonides and &AElig;schylus
to the production of masterpieces may have stirred the spirit of
the youthful patriot of Agrigentum. Another composition of
Empedocles which perished under his sister's hands was a Proemium
to Apollo. The loss of this poem is deeply to be regretted.
Empedocles regarded himself as specially protected by the god
of song and medicine and prophetic insight. His genius would
therefore naturally take its highest flight in singing praises to this
mighty patron. The hymn to Zeus, which has been ascribed to
Cleanthes, and some of the pseudo-Orphic declamations, may give
us an idea of the gravity and enthusiasm which Empedocles would
have displayed in treating so stirring a theme. Of his remaining
works we possess fragments. The great poem on Nature, the
Lustral Precepts, and the Discourse on Medicine were all celebrated
among the ancients. Fortunately, the inductions to the
first and second of these have been preserved, and some lines addressed
to Pausanias may be regarded as forming the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of the third. It is from these fragments, amounting in all
to about 470 lines, that we must form our judgment of Empedocles,
the poet and the sage.</p>

<p>That Empedocles was a poet of the didactic order is clear from
the nature of his subjects. Even as early as the time of Aristotle,
critics disputed as to whether poems written for the purpose of
scientific instruction deserved the name of poetry. In the <i>Poetics</i>,
Aristotle says, &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8057;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8009;&#956;&#8053;&#961;&#8179; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7960;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#948;&#959;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#8150; &#960;&#955;&#8052;&#957;
&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8051;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#903; &#948;&#953;&#8056; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#8055;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#8057;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957;
&#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#7970; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#8053;&#957;.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The title &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#8057;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;, or philosopher of nature,
was of course generic, and might have been claimed by Heraclitus,
on the strength of his prose writings, no less than by Empedocles.
Lucretius, in the exordium to his poem, argues for the
utility of disguising scientific precepts under the more attractive
form of art; as we sweeten the lips of the vessel that contains
bitter medicine, in order to induce the child to take it readily.
And not only had Empedocles this reason in his favor for the use
of verse, but also, at the age in which he lived, it was still a novelty
to write prose at all; nor would it have been consistent with
his theories of inspiration, and with the mysticism he professed,
to abandon the poetic form of utterance. He therefore thought
and wrote hexameters as naturally as the scientific men of the
present day think and write their sentences and paragraphs, until
the discourse is formed into a perfect whole. Allowing, then,
for the subject of his poem, Empedocles was regarded by antiquity
as first among the Greek didactic singers, though he competed
with Parmenides for this distinction, and was placed upon a level
with Lucretius. Lactantius mentions them both together, in his
definition of this kind of poetry. And Aristotle, in another treatise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>now lost, but quoted by Diogenes, praises the artistic genius
of the philosopher in these words: &#922;&#945;&#8054; &#8009;&#956;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#8001; &#7960;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#948;&#959;&#954;&#955;&#8134;&#962;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#966;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#947;&#8051;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#962; &#964;&#949; &#8034;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#962;
&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#8059;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953; &#967;&#961;&#8061;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The epithet &#8009;&#956;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962;
is very just; for not only is it clear that Empedocles had studied
the poems of Homer with care, and had imbibed their phraseology,
but he also possessed a genius akin to that of Homer in love
of simplicity, in fidelity to nature, in unimpeded onward flow of
energetic verse.</p>

<p>The simile of the girl playing with a water-clock, whereby Empedocles
illustrates his theory of respiration, and that of the lantern,
which serves to explain his notion of the structure of the
eye, are both of them Homeric in their unadorned simplicity and
vigor. Again, such epithets as these, &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#945;&#8055;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957; (full-blooded)
for the liver, &#7985;&#955;&#8049;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945; (gentle) for the moon, &#8000;&#958;&#965;&#946;&#949;&#955;&#8052;&#962; (quick-darting)
for the sun, &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#8051;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962; (crowned) for majesty, &#952;&#949;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#8182;&#960;&#953;&#962;
(grave-visaged) for harmony, and the constant repetition of &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8054;
&#948;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#967;&#945;&#8055;&#969;&#957;&#949;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#956;&#8135;&#963;&#953; &#966;&#8051;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953; (the long-aged gods in honor foremost),
have the true Homeric ring. Like Homer, he often chooses
an epithet specific of the object which he wishes to describe, but
not especially suited to the matter of his argument. Thus &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#954;&#955;&#945;&#8059;&#964;&#969;&#957;
&#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#8055;&#954;&#969;&#957; (women given to tears) occurs where there is
no particular reason to fix the mind upon the tearfulness of women.
But the poetic value of the passage is increased by the mind
being thus carried away from the logical order of ideas to a generality
on which it can repose. At other times, when this is necessary,
the epithets are as accurately descriptive as those of a
botanist or zoologist: &#7952;&#957; &#954;&#8057;&#947;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#953; &#952;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#946;&#945;&#961;&#965;&#957;&#8061;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; (in
whelks that inhabit the sea with heavy backs) ... &#955;&#953;&#952;&#959;&#961;&#961;&#8055;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#949;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>&#967;&#949;&#955;&#969;&#957;&#8182;&#957; (stony-coated tortoises), for example. Again, Empedocles
gives rein to his imagination by creating bold metaphors; he
calls the flesh &#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#8182;&#957; &#967;&#953;&#964;&#8061;&#957; (a robe of flesh), and birds &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#8049;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#962;
&#954;&#8059;&#956;&#946;&#945;&#962; (boats that move with wings). Referring to his
four elements, he thus personifies their attributes: "Fiery Zeus,
and Her&egrave;, source of vital breath, and Aidoneus, and Nestis, with
her tears." At another time he speaks of "earth, and ocean with
his countless waves, and liquid air, the sun-god and ether girdling
round the universe in its embrace."</p>

<p>The passage, too, in which he describes the misery of earth
rises to a sublime height. It may well have served as the original
of Virgil's celebrated lines in the sixth &AElig;neid:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I lifted up my voice, I wept and wailed, when I beheld the unfamiliar
shore. A hideous shore, on which dwell murder, envy, and the troop of baleful
destinies, wasting corruption, and disease. Through At&eacute;'s meadow they
go wandering up and down in gloom. There was the queen of darkness, and
Heliope with her far-searching eyes, and bloody strife, and mild-eyed peace,
beauty and ugliness, swiftness and sloth, and lovely truth, and insincerity
with darkling brows. Birth too and death, slumber and wakefulness, motion
and immobility, crowned majesty and squalid filth, discordant clamor and the
voice of gods."</p></div>

<p>We can understand by these passages how Empedocles not only
was compared with Homer by Aristotle, but also with Thucydides
and &AElig;schylus by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who speaks of his
"austere harmony" (&#945;&#8016;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#8048;&#957; &#7937;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#945;&#957;). The conciseness of his
argumentative passages, the breadth of his treatment, and the dryness
of his coloring, to quote the terms of painting, resemble the
style of Thucydides, while his bold figures and gloomy grandeur
are like those of &AElig;schylus. Plutarch, in the treatise on the genius
of Socrates, speaks of the style of Empedocles at large, both
as regards his poems and his theories, as "inspired with dithyrambic
ecstasy" (&#956;&#8049;&#955;&#945; &#946;&#949;&#946;&#945;&#954;&#967;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;). This seems a contradiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
to the "austere harmony" of Dionysius. But there are passages
which justify the title. This exordium, for instance, savors
of prophetic fury:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It stands decreed by fate, an ancient ordinance of the immortal gods, established
from everlasting, ratified by ample oaths, that, when a spirit of that
race, which has inherited the length of years divine, sinfully stains his limbs
with blood, he must go forth to wander thrice ten thousand years from heaven,
passing from birth to birth through every form of mortal mutability, changing
the toilsome paths of life without repose, even as I now roam, exiled from
God, an outcast on this world, the bondman of insensate strife.</p>

<p>"Alas, ill-fated race of mortals, thrice accursed! from what dire struggles
and what groans have ye been born! The air in its anger drives them to the
sea, and ocean spues them forth upon the solid land, earth tosses them into
the flames of the untiring sun, he flings them back again into the whirlwinds
of the air; from one to the other are they cast, and all abhor them."</p></div>

<p>And the following adjuration has a frantic energy, to modern
readers almost laughable but for its indubitable gravity:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wretches, thrice wretches, keep your hands from beans!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or, again, with reference to the abomination of animal food:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The father drags along his dear son changed in form, and slays him,
pouring prayers upon his head. But the son goes begging mercy from his
maniac sire. The father heeds him not, but goads him on, and, having
slaughtered him, prepares a cursed meal. In like manner sons take their
fathers, and children their mothers, and tearing out the life devour the kindred
flesh. Will ye not put an end to this accursed slaughter? Will ye not
see that ye consume each other in blind ignorance of soul?"</p></div>

<p>It is not strange that the poems of Empedocles were pilfered by
oracle-mongers in after-ages.</p>

<p>Besides these passages, there are some of a milder beauty
which deserve high praise for their admirable power of suggesting
the picture that the poet wishes to convey. The following
lines describe the golden age of old, to which Empedocles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> looked
back with melancholy longing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There every animal was tame and familiar with men, both beasts and
birds, and mutual love prevailed. Trees flourished with perpetual leaves and
fruits, and ample crops adorned their boughs through all the year. Nor had
these happy people any Ares or mad Uproar for their god; nor was their
monarch Zeus, or Kronos, or Poseidon, but Queen Cypris. Her favor they besought
with pious symbols and with images, and fragrant essences, and censers
of pure myrrh, and frankincense, and with brown honey poured upon
the ground. The altars did not reek with bullocks' gore."</p></div>

<p>It may sound ridiculous to say so, yet Empedocles resembles
Shelley in the quality of his imagination and in many of his utterances.
The lines just quoted, the belief in a beneficent universal
soul of nature, the hatred of animal food, the love of all
things moving or growing on the face of earth, the sense of ancient
misery and present evil, are all, allowing for the difference
of centuries and race and education, points by which the Greek
and the English poets meet in a community of nature. Two
more passages illustrative of the poetical genius of Empedocles
may be quoted. In the first he describes the nature of God, invisible
and omnipresent. In the second he asserts the existence
of a universal law. They are both remarkable for simplicity and
force, and elevation of style:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Blessed is the man who hath obtained the riches of the wisdom of God;
wretched is he who hath a false opinion about things divine.</p>

<p>"He (God) may not be approached, nor can we reach him with our eyes or
touch him with our hands. No human head is placed upon his limbs, nor
branching arms; he has no feet to carry him apace, nor other parts of man;
but he is all pure mind, holy, and infinite, darting with swift thought through
the universe from end to end."</p>

<p>"This law binds all alike, and none are free from it: the common ordinance
which all obey prevails through the vast spaces of wide-ruling air and
the illimitable fields of light in endless continuity."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p>The quotations which have served to illustrate the poetical
genius of Empedocles have also exhibited one aspect of his philosophy&mdash;that
wherein he was connected with the Pythagoreans.
It is quite consistent with the whole temper of his intellect that
he should have been attracted to the semi-Oriental mysticism
which then was widely spread through Grecian Italy and Sicily.
After the dissolution of the monastic commonwealth founded by
Pythagoras, it is probable that refugees imbued with his social
and political theories scattered themselves over the adjacent cities,
and from some of these men Empedocles may have imbibed
in early youth the dream-like doctrines of an antenatal life, of
future immortality, of past transgression and the need of expiation,
of abstinence, and of the bond of fellowship which bound
man to his kindred sufferers upon the earth. It is even asserted
in one legend that the philosopher of Agrigentum belonged to
the Pythagorean Society, and was expelled from it for having
been the first to divulge its secrets. In later life these theories
were developed by Empedocles after his own fashion, and received
a peculiar glow of poetic coloring from his genius. There is no
need to suppose that he visited the East and learned the secrets
of Gymnosophists. A few Pythagorean seeds sown in his fruitful
soil sprang up and bore a hundred-fold. Referring to the
exordium of his poem on Nature, and to the lines in which he
describes the unapproachable Deity, we find that Empedocles believed
in a pristine state of happiness, when the "D&aelig;mons," or
"gods, long of life, supreme in honor," dwelt together, enjoying
a society of bliss. Yet this state was not perfect, for some of
these immortals stained their hands with blood, and some spoke
perjury, and so sin entered in and tainted heaven. After such
offence the erring spirit, by the fateful, irrevocable, and perennial
law of the divine commonwealth, had to relinquish his heavenly
throne and wander "thirty thousand seasons" apart from his
comrades. In this period of exile he passed through all th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>e
changes of metempsychosis. According to the rigorous and
gloomy conception of Empedocles, this change was caused by the
hatred of the elements: earth, air, fire, and water refusing to retain
the criminal, and tossing him about from one to the other
without intermission. Thus, he might be a plant, a bird, a fish,
a beast, or a human being in succession. But the transmigration
did not depend upon mere chance. If the tortured spirit, environed,
as he was, by the conflicting shapes and contradictory
principles and baleful destinies which crowded earth&mdash;"the over-vaulted
cave," the "gloomy meadow of discord," as Empedocles
in his despair described our globe&mdash;could yet discover some faint
glimmering of the truth, seize and hold fast some portion of the
heavenly clue, then he might hope to reascend to bliss. Instead
of abiding among birds and unclean beasts and common plants,
his soul passed into the bodies of noble lions and mystic bay-trees,
or became a bard, a prophet, a ruler among men, and lastly
rose again to the enjoyment of undying bliss. Throughout these
wanderings death was impossible. Empedocles laughed at the
notion of birth and death; he seems to have believed in a fixed
number of immortal souls, capable of any transformation, but incapable
of perishing. Therefore, when his spirits, falling earthward,
howled at the doleful aspect of the hideous land, the very
poignancy of their grief consisted in that bitter thought of Dante's,
"questi non hanno speranza di morte"&mdash;in that thought
which makes the Buddhist welcome annihilation. It has been
already hinted, that although the soul by its forced exile lost not
only happiness but also knowledge, yet the one might be in part
retrieved, and the other toilsomely built up again in some degree
by patient observation, prayer, and magic rites. On this point
hinges the philosophy of Empedocles. It is here that his mysticism
and his science are united into one system. In like manner,
Plato's philosophy rests upon the doctrine of Anamnesis, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>d is
connected with the vision of a past beatitude, the tradition of a
miserable fall, and the prospect of a possible restoration. Empedocles,
like Parmenides and Xenophanes in their disquisitions
on the eternal Being, like Plato in his references to the Supreme
Idea, seems to have imagined that the final Essence of the universe
was unapproachable, and to have drawn a broad distinction
between the rational and sensual orders, between the world as
cognizable by pure intellect, and the world as known through the
medium of human sense. The lines of Empedocles upon God,
which have been already quoted, are similar to those of Xenophanes:
both philosophers assert the existence of an unknown
Deity pavilioned in dense inscrutability, yet not the less to be regarded
as supreme and omnipresent and omnipotent&mdash;as God of
gods, as life of life. How to connect this intuition with the
physical speculations of Empedocles is difficult. The best way
seems to be to refrain from identifying his eloquent description
of the unknown God with the Sph&aelig;rus of his scientific theories,
and to believe that he regarded the same universe from different
points of view at different times, as if in moments of high exaltation
he obtained a glimpse of the illimitable Being by a process
of ecstatic illumination, while in more ordinary hours of meditation
his understanding and his senses helped him to obtain a
knowledge of the actual phenomena of this terrestrial globe.
His own language confirms this view of the case:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Weak and narrow," he says, "are the powers implanted in the limbs of
men; many the woes that fall on them and blunt the edge of thought; short
is the measure of the life in death through which they toil; then are they
borne away, like smoke they vanish into air, and what they dream they know
is but the little each hath stumbled on in wandering about the world; yet
boast they all that they have learned the whole&mdash;vain fools! for what <i>that</i> is,
no eye hath seen, no ear hath heard, nor can it be conceived by mind of man.
Thou, then, since thou hast fallen to this place, shalt know no more than hu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>man
wisdom may attain.</p>

<p>"But, O ye gods, avert the madness of those babblers from my tongue,
and cause the stream of holy words to issue from my hallowed lips. And
thou, great Muse of Memory, maiden with the milk-white arms, I pray to thee
to teach me things that creatures of a day may hear. Come from the House
of Holiness, and bring to me her harnessed car."</p></div>

<p>Here we see plainly set forth the impossibility of mortal, fallen
intellects attaining to a perfect knowledge of the Universe, the
impiety of seeking such knowledge, or pretending to have found
it; and, at the same time, the limitations under which true science
remains within the reach of human beings. How this science
may be reached, he tells us in some memorable lines, probably
supposed to issue from the lips of the Muse whom he invokes:
"But come, search diligently, and discover what is clear in every
realm of sense, ... check the conviction of thy senses, and judge
by reason what is evident in every case."</p>

<p>Thus the senses, although feeble and erring guides, are, after all,
the gates to knowledge; and their reports, when tested by the
light of reason, form the data for human speculation. The senses,
resident in the limbs, are composed in certain proportions of the
four elements, which also constitute the earth. Therefore, between
the frame of man and the world outside him, there is a
community of substance, whereby he is enabled to know. &#8013;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#945;
&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#8055;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#947;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; (likes are known by likes) is the foundation of
our philosopher's theory of knowledge. The rational soul, being
that immortal part of man whereon depends his personal identity,
whether he take the shape of plant or animal, receives and judges
the results of sensation. This theory, it will be observed, has a
kind of general similarity to that of Parmenides. Empedocles
draws a marked difference between the province of the senses and
of the reason, and inveighs against the impotence of the former.
Again, he speaks of the real being of the world as pure and perf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>ect
intellect; and at the same time elaborately describes the universe
as it appears to human sense and understanding. But here
the likeness ends. Parmenides has no mysticism, and indulges in
no theology. He believes in the actual truth of his rational ontology,
and sneers at the senses. "Thy fate it is," he says, "all
mysteries to learn, both the unswerving mind of truth that wins a
sure assent, and the vain thoughts of men, in which no certainty
abides. But, baseless as they are, these also shalt thou learn;
since thou must traverse every field of knowledge, and discern the
fabric of the dreams of men." His ontology is just as elaborate
as his physics, and he evidently considers its barren propositions
of more value than any observations on astronomy or physiology.
Empedocles, on the other hand, despaired of ontology, and gave
all his mind to explanations of the physical universe&mdash;how it came
to be, and what laws governed its alternations&mdash;believing all along
that there was a higher region of pure intellect beyond the reach
of his degraded soul. "Here we see in a glass darkly, but then
face to face." In this respect he resembled Xenophanes more
than Parmenides. Xenophanes had said, "No man hath been,
nor will ever be, who knows for certain all about the gods, and
everything of which I speak; for should one publish the most
sure and settled truth, yet even he cannot be said to <i>know</i>: opinion
is supreme in all things." Empedocles belonged more to the
age behind him than to that which followed; and his extensive
knowledge of nature was a part of his artistic rather than his scientific
temperament.</p>

<p>Yet, allowing for the march of human progress during twenty-three
centuries, we are bound to hold much the same language as
Empedocles regarding the limitations of knowledge. We have,
indeed, infinitely extended our observation of phenomena; we
have gained fuller conceptions of the Deity and of the destinies
of man. But the plummet which he threw into the bottomless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
abyss of science has as yet found no bottom, and the circle which
it made by striking on the surface of the illimitable ocean has
grown and grown, but yet has touched no shore on any side. Like
him, we still speak of an unapproachable God, utterly beyond the
reach of human sense and intellect; like him, we still content ourselves
with receiving the reports of our senses, comparing and
combining them by means of our understanding, and thus obtaining
some conception of the universe in which we live. If we reject
the light of Christianity, the guesses which we form about a
future world are less vague than those of Empedocles, but founded
on no surer scientific basis; the God we worship still remains
enveloped in symbols; we still ascribe to him, if not a human
form, at least the reason, partialities, and passions of mankind.
Indeed, in this respect, the sage of Agrigentum stood unconsciously
upon the platform which only our profoundest thinkers have
attained. He felt the awe of the Unseen&mdash;he believed in the infinite
Being; but he refused to dogmatize about his attributes,
confining his own reason to the phenomenal universe which he
strove in every way to understand, and to employ for the good of
his race. Empedocles was greater than most of his contemporaries,
for he neither believed it possible to explain the whole mystery
of the world, nor did he yet reject the notion of there being
a profound mystery. He steered clear between the Parmenides
and Democritus of his own day&mdash;between the Spinoza and the
materialist of modern speculation. Herein the union of philosophy
and poetry, of thought and feeling, in his nature, gave the
tone to all his theories. We must not, however, in our praise forget
that all these problems appeared in a far more simple form to
the Greeks of that age than to ourselves, and were therefore more
hastily and lightly answered. Between the ontology of Parmenides
and that of Hegel what a step there is! What meagre associations
gather round the one; what many-sided knowledge gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
substance to the other!</p>

<p>Remembering, therefore, in what light Empedocles regarded his
own physical speculations, we may proceed to discuss them more
in detail. We shall find that he deserved a large portion of that
praise which Bacon rather whimsically lavished on the pre-Socratic
philosophers, to the disadvantage of the mightier names of
Plato and Aristotle.</p>

<p>The poem on Nature is addressed to Pausanias the physician,
who was a son of Anchitus of Agrigentum, and a special friend
of Empedocles. To Pausanias the philosopher begins his instruction
with these words: "First learn what are the four chief roots
of everything that is: fiery Zeus, and Her&egrave;, source of vital breath,
and Aidoneus, and Nestis with her tears, who is the fount of
moisture in the world." Thus Empedocles, after the fashion of
the Pythagoreans, allegorized his four elements. In other passages
he calls them "fire, water, earth, and air's immeasurable
height;" or, "earth, and ocean with his countless waves, and liquid
air, the sun-god, and ether girdling the universe in its embrace;" or
again, "Heph&aelig;stus, rain, and radiant ether;" or lastly, "light,
earth, heaven, and ocean." It will be seen that he designated his
elements sometimes by mythological titles, sometimes by abstract
terms, and sometimes by selecting one or other natural object&mdash;such
as the sun, the air, the ocean&mdash;in which they were most manifest.
It is well known that Empedocles was the first philosopher
to adopt the four elements, which, since his day, continued to rule
supreme over natural science, until modern analysis revealed far
simpler and broader bases. Other speculators of the Ionian sect
had maintained each of these four elements&mdash;Thales the water,
Anaximenes the air, Heraclitus the fire, and perhaps (but this
rests on no sure evidence), Pherecydes the earth. Xenophanes
had said, "Of earth and water are all things that come into existence."
Parmenides had spoken of dark and light, thick and subtile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
substances. Each of these fundamental principles is probably
to be regarded not as pure fire, or pure water, or pure air, but as
a universal element differing in rarity, and typified according to
the analogical necessities of language, by means of some familiar
object. The four elements of Empedocles appear to have been
suggested to him, partly by his familiarity with contemporary
speculation, and partly by his observation of Nature. They held
their ground so long in scientific theory, because they answered so
exactly to a superficial view of the world. Earth with everything
of a solid quality, water including every kind of fluid, fire that
burns or emits light, air that can be breathed, appear to constitute
an exhaustive division of the universe. Of the eternity of these
four primal substances, according to the Empedoclean theory,
there is no doubt. The philosopher frequently reiterates his belief
in the impossibility of an absolute beginning or ending, though
he acquiesces in the popular use of these terms to express the scientific
conceptions of dissolution and recombination.</p>

<p>These elements, then, were the material part of the world according
to Empedocles. But inherent in them, as a tendency is
inherent in an organism, and yet separable in thought from them,
as the soul is separable from the body, were two conflicting principles
of equal power, love and discord. Love and discord by
their operation wrought infinite changes in the universe: for it
was the purpose of love to bind the elements together into a
compact, smooth, motionless globe; and of discord to separate
them one from another, and to keep them distinct in a state of
mutual hostility. When, therefore, either love or discord got the
upper-hand, the phenomenal universe could not be said to exist,
but in the intermediate state was a perpetual order of growth
and decay, composition and dissolution, whereby the world, as we
behold it, came into existence. This intermediate state, <i>das Werdende</i>,
&#964;&#8056; &#947;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8059;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; (the Becoming, that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
comes into existence and passes out of it again by dissolution),
was &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#962;, or Nature. The conflicting energies of love and discord
formed the pulses of its mighty heart, the systole and diastole
of its being, the one power tending to life, the other power
to death, the one pushing all the elements forward to a perfect
unity of composition, the other rending them apart. To the universe
when governed by love in supremacy Empedocles gave the
name of &#963;&#966;&#945;&#8150;&#961;&#959;&#962; (perfect globe), which he also called a god. This
&#963;&#966;&#945;&#8150;&#961;&#959;&#962; answered to the Eleatic &#7955;&#957;, while the disjointed elements
subservient to the force of strife corresponded to the Eleatic
&#960;&#8057;&#955;&#955;&#945;. Thus the old Greek antagonism of Good and Evil, One
and Many, Love and Hatred, Being and Not-being, were interpreted
by Empedocles. He looked on all that is, <i>das Werdende</i>,
as transitory between two opposite and contradictory existences.</p>

<p>Again, according to his system, the alternate reigns of love and
discord succeeded one another at fixed intervals of time; so that,
from one point of view, the world was ceaselessly shifting, and
from another point of view, was governed by eternal and unalterable
Law. Thus he reconciled the Heraclitean flux and the Parmenidean
immobility by a middle term. Each of the elements
possessed a separate province, had separate functions, and was
capable of standing by itself. To fire it would seem that the
philosopher assigned a more active influence than to any of the
other elements; therefore a kind of dualism may be recognized
in his Universe between this ruling principle and the more passive
ingredients of air, earth, and water. The influence of love and
harmony kept them joined and interpenetrated, and so mingled
as to bring the different objects which we see around us into being.
Empedocles professed to understand the proportions of
these mixtures, and measured them by Pythagorean rules of
arithmetic. Thus everything subsists by means of transformation
and mixture; absolute beginning and ending are impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, briefly stated, is the theory of Empedocles. The following
passage may be quoted to show how the phenomenal Universe
comes into being under the influence of love:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When strife has reached the very bottom of the seething mass, and love
assumes her station in the centre of the ball, then everything begins to come
together, and to form one whole&mdash;not instantaneously, but different substances
come forth, according to a steady process of development. Now,
when these elements are mingling, countless kinds of things issue from their
union. Much, however, remains unmixed, in opposition to the mingling elements,
and these malignant strife still holds within his grasp. For he has
not yet withdrawn himself altogether to the extremities of the globe; but
part of his limbs still remain within its bounds, and part have passed beyond.
As strife, however, step by step, retreats, mild and innocent love pursues him
with her force divine; things which had been immortal instantly assume
mortality; the simple elements become confused by interchange of influence.
When these are mingled, then the countless kinds of mortal beings issue
forth, furnished with every sort of form&mdash;a sight of wonder."</p></div>

<p>In another passage this development is compared to the operation
of a painter mixing his colors, and forming with them a
picture of various objects. Discord is said to have made the elements
immortal, because he kept them apart, and would willingly
have preserved their separate qualities; whereas love mixes them
together, breaks up their continuity, and confuses their kinds.
What Empedocles exactly meant by Sph&aelig;ris is hard to understand;
nor do we know how far he intended Chance to operate
in the formation of the Universe. He often uses such expressions
as these, "So they chanced to come together," and describes
the amorphous condition of the first organisms in a way
that makes one think he fancied a perfectly chaotic origin. Yet
"the art of Aphrodite," "so Cypris ordained their form," are assertions
of designing intelligence. In fact, we may well believe
that Empedocles, in the infancy of speculation, was led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> astray by
his double nomenclature. When talking of Aphrodite, he naturally
thought of a person ruling creation; when using the term
"Love," he naturally conceived an innate tendency, which might
have been the sport of chance in a great measure. It also appears
probable that, when Empedocles spoke of "Chance" and
"Necessity," he referred to some inherent quality in the elements
themselves, whereby they grew together under certain laws, and
that the harmony and discord which ruled them in turn were regarded
by him as forces aiding and preventing their union.</p>

<p>To understand the order of creation, we may begin by imagining
the sphere, which, in the words of Empedocles, "by the hidden
bond of harmony is stablished, and rejoices in unbroken
rest ... in perfect equipoise, of infinite extent, it stays a full-orbed
sphere rejoicing in unbroken rest." Love now is omnipotent;
she has knit all the elements into one whole; Discord has
retreated, and abides beyond the globe. But soon his turn begins:
he enters the sphere, and "all the limbs of the god begin
to tremble." Now the elements are divided one from the other&mdash;ether
first, then fire, then earth, then water from the earth.
Still the elements are chaotic; but wandering about the spaces of
the world, and "permeating each the other's realm," they form
alliances and tend to union. Love is busy no less than Discord.
The various tribes of plants and animals appear at first in a rudimentary
and monstrous condition: "many heads sprouted up
without necks, and naked arms went wandering forlorn of shoulders,
and solitary eyes were straying destitute of foreheads."
Still the process of seething and intermingling continued; "when
element with element more fully mixed, these members fell together
by hap-hazard ... many came forth with double faces and
two breasts, some shaped like oxen with a human front, others,
again, of human race with a bull's head; and some were mixed
of male and female parts." Unfortunately, the lines in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> he
describes the further progress of development have been lost, and
we do not know how the interval between chaos and order was
bridged over in his system. Only with reference to human beings
he asserts that in the earliest stage they were produced in
amorphous masses, containing the essence, as it were, of both
male and female; and that after the separation of these masses
into two parts, each part yearned to join its tally. And therefrom
sprang the passion of desire in human hearts. This theory
has been worked out by Plato artistically in the <i>Symposium</i>.
Also with reference to the accretion of the phenomenal universe,
he says that earth formed the basis of all hard and solid substances
preponderating in the shells of fish, and so on. Bones
were wrought of earth and fire and water, "marvellously jointed
by the bonds of Harmony." It is needless to follow Empedocles
through all his scattered fancies, to show that he knew that the
night was caused by the earth intercepting the sun's rays, or that
he thought the sun reflected heaven's fire like a mirror, or that he
placed the intellect in the blood, and explained respiration by a
theory of pores, and the eyesight by imagining a fire shut up
within the pupil. The fragments we possess are too scanty to
allow of our obtaining a perfect view of his physical theory; all
we gather from them is that Empedocles possessed more acquired
and original knowledge than any of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>It may appear from what has been said about his system that
Empedocles was at best a great eclectic. But this is not entirely
the case. If he deserves the name of eclectic, he deserves it in
the same sense as Plato, though it need not be said how infinitely
inferior, as an original thinker, he is to Plato. Empedocles
was deeply versed in all the theories, metaphysical, cosmogonical,
mystical, and physiological, of his age. He viewed from a high
station all the problems, intellectual, social, and moral, which
then vexed Greece. But he did not pass his days in a study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
or a lecture-room, nor did he content himself with expounding
or developing the theories of any one master. He went abroad,
examined nature for himself, cured the sick, thought his own
thoughts, and left an impress on the constitution of his native
state. In his comprehensive mind all the learning he had acquired
from men, from books, from the world, and from reflection,
was consolidated into one system, to which his double interest
for mysticism and physics gave a double aspect. He was
the first in Greece to reconcile Eleatic and Heraclitean speculations,
the puzzle of plurality and unity, the antagonism of good
and evil, in one theory, and to connect it with another which revealed
a solemn view of human obligations and destinies, and required
a life of social purity and self-restraint. The misfortune
of Empedocles as a philosopher consisted in this&mdash;that he succeeded
only in resuming the results of contemporary speculation,
and of individual research, in a philosophy of indisputable originality,
without anticipating the new direction which was about to
be given to human thought by Socrates and Plato. He closed
one period&mdash;the period of poetry and physical theories and mysticism.
The period of prose, of logic, and of ethics was about to
begin. He was the last of the great colonial sages of Greece.
The Hellenic intellect was destined henceforth to centre itself at
Athens.</p>

the Gnomic.&mdash;Callinus.&mdash;Tyrt&aelig;us.&mdash;Mimnermus.&mdash;His Epicurean Philosophy

and Beauty.</p></div>


<p>The term Gnomic, when applied to a certain number of Greek
poets, is arbitrary. There is no definite principle for rejecting
some and including others in the class. It has, however, been
usual to apply this name to Solon, Phocylides, Theognis, and Simonides
of Ceos. Yet there seems no reason to exclude some
portions of Callinus, Tyrt&aelig;us, Mimnermus, and Xenophanes.
These poets, it will be observed, are all writers of the elegy.
Some of the lyric poets, however, and iambographers, such as
Simonides of Amorgos and Archilochus, have strong claims for
admission into the list. For, as the derivation of the name implies,
gnomic poets are simply those who embody &#947;&#957;&#8182;&#956;&#945;&#953;, or sententious
maxims on life and morals, in their verse; and though
we find that the most celebrated masters of this style composed
elegies, we yet may trace the thread of gnomic thought in almost
all the writers of their time. Conversely, the most genuine authors
of elegiac gnomes trespassed upon the domain of lyric
poetry, and sang of love and wine and personal experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>ence no
less than of morality. In fact, the gnomic poets represent a period
of Greek literature during which the old and simple forms of
narrative poetry were giving way to lyrical composition on the
one hand, and to meditative writing on the other; when the
epical impulse had become extinct, and when the Greeks were
beginning to think definitely. The elegy, which seems to have
originated in Asia Minor, and to have been used almost exclusively
by poets of the Ionian race for the expression of emotional and
reflective sentiments, lent itself to this movement in the development
of the Greek genius, and formed a sort of midway stage
between the impassioned epic of the Homeric age and the no less
impassioned poetry and prose of the Athenian age of gold.</p>

<p>Viewed in this light, the gnomic poets mark a transition from
Homer and Hesiod to the dramatists and moralists of Attica.
The ethical precepts inherent in the epos received from them a
more direct and proverbial treatment; while they in turn prepared
for the sophists, the orators, and Socrates.</p>

<p>This transitional period in the history of Greek literature, corresponding,
as it does, to similar transitions in politics, religion,
and morality, offers many points of interest. Before Homer, poetry
had no historical past; but after the age of the epic, a long
time elapsed before the vehicle of verse was exchanged for that
of prose. Xenophanes, Parmenides, and Empedocles wrote poems
upon nature in hexameters. Solon and Theognis committed their
state-craft and ethics to elegiac couplets. Yet at the same time
Heraclitus and the seven sages were developing the germs of
prose, and preparing the way for Attic historians and philosophers.</p>

<p>Again, whereas Homer introduces us to a Hellas small in its
extent, and scarcely separated from surrounding tribes, we find
in the transitional period that the strength and splendor of the
Greek race are dissipated over distant colonies, Hellenic civili<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>zation
standing out in definite relief against adjacent barbarism.
The first lyrical and elegiac poets come from the islands of the
Archipelago, or from the shores of Asia Minor. The first dramatists
of note are Sicilian. Italy and Sicily afford a home to the
metaphysical poets, while the philosophers of the Ionian sect
flourish at Ephesus and Miletus.</p>

<p>Corresponding to this change in the distribution of the race, a
change was taking place in the governments of the states. The
hereditary monarchies of Homer's age have disappeared, and, after
passing through a period of oligarchical supremacy, have given
place to tyrannies. The tyrants of Miletus and of Agrigentum,
rising from the aristocracy itself; those of Corinth, Athens, and
Megara, owing their power to popular favor; others, like Cylon,
flourishing awhile by force of mere audacity and skill; others,
again, like Pittacus of Mitylene, using the rights of their dictatorship
for the public benefit, had this one point in common&mdash;it
was the interest of all of them to destroy the traditional prejudices
of the race, to gather a powerful and splendid court around
them, to patronize art, to cultivate diplomacy, and to attach men
of ability to their persons. As the barons of feudalism encouraged
the romances of the Niebelungen, Carlovingian, and Arthurian
cycles, so the hereditary monarchies had caused the cyclical
epos to flourish. It was not for the interest of the tyrants to revive
Homeric legends, but rather to banish from the State all traces
of the chivalrous past. With this view Cleisthenes of Sicyon put
down the worship of Adrastus, and parodied the heroic names of
the three tribes. Poetry, thus separated from the fabulous past,
sought its subjects in the present&mdash;in personal experience, in pleasure,
in politics, in questions of diplomacy, in epigrammatic morality.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the period during which the gnomic poets
flourished&mdash;a period of courts and tyrannies, of colonia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>l prosperity,
of political animation, of social intrigue, of intellectual development,
of religious transformation, of change and uncertainty
in every department. Behind them lay primitive Homeric Hellas;
before them, at no great distance, was the time when the
Greek genius would find its home in Athens. Poetry and science
were then to be distinguished; the philosophers, historians,
and orators were to make a subtle and splendid instrument of
Greek prose; the dramatists were to develop the choric and dialectic
beauty of the Greek language to its highest possible perfection;
tyrannies were to be abolished, and the political energies of
Hellas to be absorbed in the one great struggle between the Dorian
and Ionian families. But in the age of gnomic poetry these
changes were still future; and though the mutations of Greek
history were accomplished with unparalleled rapidity, we yet may
draw certain lines and say, Here was a breathing-time of indecision
and suspense; this period was the eve before a mighty revolution.
I propose, therefore, to consider the gnomic poets as the
representatives, to some extent, of such an age, and as exponents
of the rudimentary, social, and political philosophy of Greece before
Socrates.</p>

<p>Three periods may be marked in the development of the early
Greek elegiac poetry&mdash;the Martial, the Erotic, and the Gnomic.
Callinus and Tyrt&aelig;us are the two great names by which the first
is distinguished. Mimnermus gave a new direction to this style
of composition, fitting the couplet, which had formerly been used
for military and patriotic purposes, to amatory and convivial
strains.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In after-years it never lost the impress of his genius;
so that Ovid, Tibullus, and Propertius may be regarded as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>lineal descendants of the Colophonian bard. Solon at a later
date applied the elegiac measure to severer subjects. He was
the first, perhaps, to use it for purely gnomic purposes, maintaining,
however, the martial spirit in his Salaminian verses, and imitating
the example of Mimnermus in his lighter compositions.
Phocylides, to judge by the scanty fragments which we possess
of his poems, was almost wholly gnomic in his character. But
Theognis, who is the latest and most important of the elegiac
writers of this period, combined the political, didactic, and erotic
qualities to a remarkable degree. As a poet, Simonides was
greater than any of those whom I have named; but his claims
to rank among the sententious philosophers rest more upon the
fragments of his lyrics than upon the elegiac epitaphs for which
he was so justly famed.</p>

<p>These are the poets of whom I intend to speak in detail.
Taken together with Homer and Hesiod, their works formed
the body of a Greek youth's education at the time when Gorgias
and Hippias were lecturing at Athens. From them the
contemporaries of Pericles, when boys, had learned the rules of
good society, of gentlemanly breeding, of practical morality, of
worldly wisdom. Their saws and precepts were on the lips of
the learned and the vulgar; wise men used them as the theses
for subtle arguments or the texts for oratorical discourses. Public
speakers quoted them as Scripture might be quoted in a synod
of the clergy. They pointed remarks in after-dinner conversation
or upon the market-place. Polemarchus, for instance, in
Plato's <i>Republic</i>, starts the dialogue on Justice by a maxim of
Simonides. Isocrates, the Rhetor, alludes to them as being "the
best counsellors in respect of human affairs;" and Xenophon
terms the gnomes of Theognis "a comprehensive treatise concerning
men." Having been used so commonly and largely by
the instructors of youth, and by men of all condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>tions, it was natural
that these elegies should be collected into one compendious
form, and that passages of a gnomic tendency should be extracted
from larger poems on different subjects. In this way a body
of sententious poetry grew up and received the traditional authority
of Solon, Phocylides, Simonides, and Theognis. But in the
process of compilation confusion and mistakes of all kinds occurred,
so that the same couplets were often attributed to several
authors. To bear this in mind at the outset is a matter of some
moment; for at this distance of time it is no longer possible to
decide the canon of the several elegists with accuracy. In dealing
with them, we must, therefore, not forget that we are handling
masses of heterogeneous materials roughly assigned to a few
great names.</p>

<p>The earliest elegiac poet was Callinus, a native of Ephesus, between
the years 730 and 678 B.C. His poems consist almost
exclusively of exhortations to bravery in battle. "How long will
ye lie idle?" he exclaims; "put on your valor; up to the fight,
for war is in the land!" He discourses in a bold and manly
strain upon the certainty of death, and the glory of facing it in
defence of home and country, winding up with this noble sentiment:
"The whole people mourns and sorrows for the death of
a brave-hearted man; and while he lives he is the peer of demigods."
The lines of Tyrt&aelig;us, whose prominent part during the
second Messenian war is the subject of a well-known legend, embody
the same martial and patriotic sentiments in even more
masculine verse.</p>

<p>It would be alien from my purpose to dwell long upon these
military poems, since the only gnomic character which they display
is the encouragement of a heightened honor, unselfishness,
indifference to gain, devotion to the State, and love of public
fame. Yet the moment in the history of Hellas represented by
Tyrt&aelig;us, the leader whose voice in the battle-field was like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> a
clarion to his manly Spartans, and in the council-chamber was a
whisper of Athene quelling strife, is so interesting that I cannot
omit him in this place. "Never," to use the words of M&uuml;ller,
"was the duty and the honor of bravery impressed on the youth
of a nation with so much beauty and force of language, by such
natural and touching motives." If of a truth it be, as Milton
says, the function of the poet "to inbreed and cherish in a great
people the seeds of virtue and public civility," then Tyrt&aelig;us, less
by his specific maxims than by the spirit that his verses breathe,
deserves an honored place among the bards whom Aristotle
would have classed as &#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8061;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#953;, most serviceable for the formation
of a virile and powerful temperament, most suited for
the education of Greek youth. The following translation stands
as Thomas Campbell made it from a martial elegy ascribed to the
bard of Laced&aelig;mon:<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Strangely different are the elegies of Mimnermus, the poet of
Colophon, who flourished towards the end of the seventh century
B.C.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> His name has passed into a proverb for luxurious verse,
saddened by reflections on the fleeting joys of youth, and on
the sure and steady progress of old age and death. Tyrt&aelig;us,
though a native of Attica, wrote for Spartans at war with a
strong nation; Mimnermus was born and lived among Ionian
Greeks emasculated by barbarian control and by contact with
the soft Lydians. It was of these Colophonians that Xenophanes,
a native poet, said, "Instructed in vain luxury by the Lydians,
they trailed their robes of purple through the streets, with haughty
looks, proud of their flowing locks bedewed with curious essences
and oils." For such a people the exquisitely soft and
musical verses of Mimnermus, pervaded by a tone of lingering
regret, were exactly suited. They breathe the air of sunny gardens
and cool banquet-rooms, in which we picture to ourselves
the poet lingering out a pensive life, endeavoring to crowd his
hours with pleasures of all kinds, yet ever haunted and made
fretful among his roses by the thought of wrinkles and death.
"When your youth is gone," he says, "however beautiful you
may have been, you lose the reverence of your children and
the regard of your friends." "More hideous is old age than
death. It reduces the handsome and the plain man to one level&mdash;cares
attend it&mdash;the senses and the intellects get deadened&mdash;a
man is forgotten and put out of the way." The Greek sentiment
of hatred for old age is well expressed in one epithet which Mimnermus
employs&mdash;&#7940;&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#959;&#957;, <i>formless</i>. The Greeks detested the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>ugliness and loss of grace which declining years bring with them
almost more than weakened powers or the approach of death.
Nay, "when the flower of youth is past," says Mimnermus, "it
is best to die at once." Men are like herbs, which flourish for a
while in sunshine&mdash;then comes the winter of old age, with poverty
or disease, or lack of children. His feeling for the charm of
youth was intense; he expressed it in language that reminds us
of the fervency of Sappho: "Down my flesh the sweat runs in
rivers, and I tremble when I see the flower of my equals in age
gladsome and beautiful."</p>

<p>This tender and regretful strain is repeated by Mimnermus
with a monotonous, almost pathetic persistency, as if the one
thought of inevitable age oppressed him like a nightmare day
and night. His delight in the goodliness of youth and manhood
is so acute, and his enjoyment of existence is so exquisite, that
he shrinks with loathing from the doom imposed on all things
mortal to decline and wither. "May I complete my life without
disease or cares, and may death strike me at my sixtieth year!"
Such is the prayer he utters, feeling, probably, that up to sixty
the senses may still afford him some enjoyment, and that, after
they are blunted, there is nothing left for man worth living for.
In all this, Mimnermus was true to one type of the Greek character.
I shall have occasion farther on to revert to this subject,
and to dwell again upon the fascination which the flower of youth
possessed for the Greeks, and the horror with which the ugliness
of age inspired them.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> That some escaped this kind of despair,
which to us appears unmanly, may be gathered from the beautiful
discourse upon old age with which the <i>Republic</i> of Plato
opens. Mimnermus, however, belonged to a class of men different
from Cephalus: nowhere in the whole range of literature can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>be found a more perfect specimen of unmitigated <i>ennui</i>.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In his
verse we trace the prostrate tone of the Oriental, combined with
Greek delicacy of intellect and artistic expression. The following
passage may be cited as at once illustrative of his peculiar
lamentation, and also of his poetical merits:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What's life or pleasure wanting Aphrodite?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When to the gold-haired goddess cold am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When love and love's soft gifts no more delight me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor stolen dalliance, then I fain would die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! fair and lovely bloom the flowers of youth;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On men and maids they beautifully smile:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon comes doleful eld, who, void of ruth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Indifferently afflicts the fair and vile:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cares wear out the heart; old eyes forlorn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Scarce reck the very sunshine to behold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unloved by youths, of every maid the scorn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hard a lot God lays upon the old.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are not surprised to hear that the fragments of Mimnermus
belonged to a series of elegies addressed to a flute-player
called Nanno.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> They are worthy of such a subject. Nanno, according
to one account, did not return the passion of the poet.</p>

<p>In Mimnermus, however luxurious he may have been, we yet
observe a vein of meditation upon life and destiny which prepares
us for the more distinctly gnomic poets. Considered in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>the light of Greek philosophy, Mimnermus anticipates the ethical
teaching of the Hedonists and Epicureans. In other words, he
represents a genuine view of life adopted by the Greeks. Horace
refers to him as an authority in these well-known lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Si, Mimnermus uti censet, sine amore jocisque<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nil est jucundum, vivas in amore jocisque;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>on which the scholiast observed that the elegiac poet "agreed
with the sect of the Epicureans."</p>

<p>Next to Mimnermus in point of time is Solon. Perhaps the
verses of this great man were among his least important productions.
Yet their value, in illustrating the history of Athens, would
have been inestimable, had they been preserved to us in a more
perfect state. "There is hardly anything," says Grote, "more to
be deplored, amidst the lost treasures of the Grecian mind, than
the poems of Solon; for we see by the remaining fragments that
they contained notices of the public and social phenomena before
him, which he was compelled attentively to study, blended with
the touching expression of his own personal feelings, in the post,
alike honorable and difficult, to which the confidence of his countrymen
had exalted him." The interest of Solon as a gnomic
poet is derived chiefly from the fact that he was reckoned one of
the seven wise men of Greece, that he was one of the two most
distinguished Nomothet&aelig; of Hellas, that he is said to have conversed
familiarly with the great Lydian monarch, and that he endeavored
at Athens to resist the growing tyranny of Pisistratus.
Thus Solon bore a prominent part in all the most important affairs
of the period to which the gnomic poetry belongs. Its politics,
diplomacy, and social theories, its constitutional systems and
philosophy, were perfectly familiar to him, and received a strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>impress from his vigorous mind. It is thought that his poems
belong to an early period of his life; yet they embody the same
sentiments as those which Herodotus refers to his old age, and
express in the looser form of elegiac verse the gist of apothegms
ascribed to him as one of the seven sages.</p>

<p>Literature and politics were cultivated together at this period
among the Greeks; philosophy was gained in actual life and by
commerce with men of all descriptions. The part which Tyrt&aelig;us,
Alc&aelig;us, Pythagoras, Parmenides, Empedocles, and Archilochus
played in the history of their states need not be more than alluded
to. Simonides of Amorgos founded a colony; Theognis
represented a large and important party. But Solon, in a truer
sense than any of these men, combined decisive action in public
life with letters. Nor is it, perhaps, necessary to agree with Grote
in depreciating the poetical value of his verses. Some of them
are very fine and forcible. The description, for example, of the
storm which sweeps away the clouds, and leaves a sunny sky
(Frag. 13, ed. Bergk), is full of noble imagery.</p>

<p>The first three fragments of Solon's elegies form part of the
ode recited by him in the market-place of Athens, when he braved
the penalty of death, and urged his fellow-citizens "to rise and
fight for the sweet isle of Salamis." These lines are followed by
a considerable fragment of great importance, describing the misery
of ill-governed and seditious Athens. Among the sayings
attributed to Solon (Diog. Laer., i. 63) is one that gives the keynote
to this poem. When asked what made an orderly and well-constituted
state, he answered, "When the people obey the rulers,
and the rulers obey the laws." The paraphrase which I subjoin
exhibits in strong contrast the difference between Dysnomia and
Eunomia, as conceived by the Athenian lawgiver. Demosthenes,
who used the name of Solon on all occasions with imposing rhetorical
effect, quotes these lines in a celebrated passage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
speech <i>De Fals. Leg.</i>, 254: "The citizens seek to overthrow the
state by love of money, by following indulgent and self-seeking
demagogues, who neglect religion and pervert the riches of the
temples. Yet justice, silent but all-seeing, will in time bring vengeance
on them for these things. War, want, civil discord, slavery,
are at our gates; and all these evils threaten Athens because
of her lawlessness. Whereas good laws and government set all
the state in order, chain the hands of evil-doers, make rough
places plain, subdue insolence, and blast the budding flowers of
At&eacute;, set straight the crooked ways of tortuous law, root out sedition,
quell the rage of strife; under their good influence all things
are fair and wise with men." Thus early and emphatically was
the notion of just balance enunciated among the Greeks. It
formed the ruling principle of their philosophy as well as of
their politics; for the &#956;&#951;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#957; (nothing overmuch) of Solon
corresponded to the &#956;&#8051;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957; (measure) of the Ionic speculators,
and contained within itself the germ of Aristotle's ethical system,
no less than of the political philosophy of Plato's <i>Republic</i>.</p>

<p>In the fifth and sixth fragments Solon describes the amount of
power he would wish to see intrusted to the Athenian Demus; in
the ninth, he prophesies the advent of a despot: "From storm-clouds
descend furious snow and hail, and thunder is born of
bright lightning; so great men produce the overthrow of states,
and into the bondage of a despot's power the people fall unwittingly.
Easy it is to raise the storm, but hard to curb the whirlwind;
yet must we now take thought of all these things." Fragment
the second contains a farther warning on the subject of
impending tyranny. The power of Pisistratus was growing to a
head, and Solon told the Athenians that if he proved despotic,
they would have no one but themselves to blame for it.</p>

<p>The remaining fragments of Solonian poetry are more purely
meditative. "Bright daughters of Memory and Olympian Zeus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>"
he begins, "Pierian Muses! hear my prayer. Grant me wealth
from the blessed gods, and from all men a good name. May I
be sweet to my friend and bitter to my foe; revered by the one
and dreaded by the other. Money I desire, but no ill-gotten gain:
for the wealth that the gods give lasts, and fleets not away; but
the fruits of insolence and crime bring vengeance&mdash;sure, though
slow. Zeus seeth all things, and like a wind scattering the clouds,
which shakes the deep places of the sea and rages over the corn-land,
and comes at last to heaven, the seat of gods, and makes a
clear sky to be seen, whereupon the sun breaks out in glory, and
the clouds are gone&mdash;so is the vengeance of Zeus. He may seem
to forget, but sooner or later he strikes; perchance the guilty
man escapes, yet his blameless children or remote posterity pay
the penalty." Two points are noticeable in this passage&mdash;first,
the dread of ill-gotten gain; and secondly, the conception of
implacable justice. There was nothing which the Greeks more
dreaded and detested than wealth procured by fraud. They were
so sensitive upon this point that even Plato and Aristotle regarded
usury as criminal, unnatural, and sure to bring calamity upon
the money-lender. Thus Chilon, the Laced&aelig;monian sage, is reported
to have said, "Choose loss rather than dishonorable gain;
for the one will hurt you for the moment, the other will never
cease to be a curse." There are few of the seven sages who have
not at least one maxim bearing on this point. It would seem as
if the conscience of humanity were touched at a very early period
by superstitious scruples of this kind. The Jewish law contains
warnings similar to those of Solon; and among our own people
it has been commonly believed that wealth unlawfully acquired,
money taken from the devil, or property wrested from the Church,
is disastrous to its owner, and incapable of being long retained in
the possession of his family. Theognis expresses nearly the same
sentiments as Solon in the following verses: "He who gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
wealth from Zeus by just means, and with hands unstained, will
not lose it; but if he acquire it wrongfully, covetously, or by
false swearing, though it may seem at first to bring him gain, at
last it turns to calamity, and the mind of Heaven prevails. But
these things deceive men, for the blessed gods do not always
take vengeance on crime at the moment of its being committed;
but one man in his person pays for a bad deed, another leaves
disaster hanging over his own children, a third avoids justice by
death."</p>

<p>Both Solon and Theognis, it will be observed, express emphatically
their belief in a vengeance of Heaven falling upon the children,
and the children's children, of offenders. This conception
of doom received its most splendid illustration at the hands of the
tragic poets, and led philosophers like Empedocles to devise systems
of expiation and purification, by means of which ancestral
guilt might be purged away, and the soul be restored to its pristine
blamelessness. Theognis in another fragment (731-752) discusses
the doctrine, and calls in question its justice. He takes it
for granted, as a thing too obvious to be disputed, that children
suffer for their father's sin, and argues with Zeus about the abstract
right and policy of this law, suggesting that its severity is
enough to make men withdraw their allegiance from such unjust
governors. The inequality of the divine rule had appeared in the
same light to Hesiod and Homer (see <i>Iliad</i>, xiii. 631; Hesiod,
<i>Op. et Dies</i>, 270). But it is in the gnomic poets that we first
discover a tendency to return and reason upon such questions:
the wedge of philosophical scepticism was being inserted into the
old beliefs of the Greek race. In some respects these gnomic poets
present even a more gloomy view of human destinies than the
epic poets. Solon says, "It is fate that bringeth good and bad to
men; nor can the gifts of the immortals be refused;" and in Theognis
we find, "No man is either wealthy or poor, mean or noble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
without the help of the gods." ... "Pray to the gods; naught
happens to man of good or ill without the gods." ... "No one,
Cyrnus, is himself the cause of loss and gain; but of both these
the gods are givers."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It would be easy to multiply passages
where the same conception of the divine government as that for
which Plato (<i>Rep.</i>, p. 379) blamed Homer is set forth; but the
gnomic poets go beyond this simple view. They seem to regard
Heaven as a jealous power, and superstitiously believe all changes
of fortune to be produced by the operation of a god anxious to
delude human expectations. This theology lies at the base of the
Solonian maxim, that you ought not to judge of a man's happiness
until his death; "for," in the language of Herodotus, "there
are many to whom God has first displayed good-fortune, and
whom he afterwards has rooted up and overthrown."</p>

<p>Thus Solon moralizes in his elegies upon the vicissitudes of
life: "Danger lies everywhere, nor can a man say where he will
end when he begins; for he who thinks to do well, without fore-thought,
comes to grief; and often when a man is doing ill, Heaven
sends him good-luck, and he ends prosperously." It must,
however, be observed that Solon in no passage of his elegiac
poems alludes distinctly to the intervention of a jealous or malicious
destiny. He is rather deeply impressed with the uncertainty
of human affairs&mdash;an uncertainty which the events of his
own life amply illustrated, and which he saw displayed in every
town about him. Simonides repeats the same strain of despondency,
dwelling (Frag. 2, ed. Gaisford) upon the mutabilities of life,
and exclaiming with a kind of horror: "One hideous Charybdis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>swallows all things&mdash;wealth and mighty virtue."</p>

<p>At this period in Greece the old simplicity of life was passing
away, and philosophy had not yet revealed her broader horizons,
her loftier aims, and her rational sources of content. We have
seen how Mimnermus bemoaned the woes of old age. Solon,
whose manliness contrasts in every other respect with the effeminacy
and languor of the Colophonian poet, gave way to the same
kind of melancholy when he cried, "No mortal man is truly blessed;
but all are wretched whom the sun beholds." What can be
more despairing than the lamentations of Simonides?&mdash;"Few and
evil are our days of life; but everlasting is the sleep which we
must sleep beneath the earth." ... "Small is the strength of man,
and invincible are his sorrows; grief treads upon the heels of
grief through his short life; and death, which no man shuns,
hangs over him at last: to this bourn come the good and bad
alike." In the midst of this uncertainty and gloom Theognis
cannot find a rule of right conduct. "Nothing," he says, "is
defined by Heaven for mortals, nor any way by which a man may
walk and please immortal powers." Nor can we point to any
more profoundly wretched expression of misery than the following
elegy of the same poet: "It is best of all things for the sons
of earth not to be born, nor to see the bright rays of the sun, or
else after birth to pass as soon as possible the gates of death, and
to lie deep down beneath a weight of earth." This sentiment
is repeated by Bacchylides, and every student of Greek tragedy
knows what splendid use has been made of it by Sophocles in
one of the choruses of <i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i>. Afterwards it passed
into a commonplace. Two Euripidean fragments embody it in
words not very different from those of Theognis, and Cicero is
said to have translated it. When we consider the uneasy and
uncertain view of human life expressed in these passages, it seems
wonderful that men, conscious of utter ignorance, and believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
themselves, like Herodotus, to be the sport of almost malignant
deities, could have grown so nobly and maintained so high a
moral standard as that of the Greek race.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The remaining fragments of Solon contain the celebrated lines
upon the Life of Man, which he divided into ten periods of seven
years. He rebuked Mimnermus for wishing to make sixty the
term of human life, and bade him add another decade. We also
possess some amorous verses of questionable character, supposed
to have been written in his early youth. The prudes of antiquity
were scandalized at Solon, a lawgiver and sage, for having penned
these couplets. The libertines rejoiced to place so respectable a
name upon their list of worthies. To the student of history they
afford, in a compact form, some insight into the pursuits and objects
of an Athenian man of pleasure. Plato quotes one couplet
in the <i>Lysis</i>, and the author of the dialogue &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7952;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#969;&#957; (On Loves),
attributed to Lucian, makes use of the same verses to prove that
Solon was not exempt from the passion for which he is apologizing.
Apuleius mentions another as "lascivissimus ille versus."
It should be added that the most considerable of these elegies has
also been ascribed to Theognis. The doubt of authorship which
hangs over all the gnomic fragments warns us, therefore, to be
cautious in ascribing them to Solon. At the same time there is
no strong external or internal argument against their authenticity.
Solon displays no asceticism in his poetry, or in anything that is
recorded of his life or sayings.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It is probable that he lived as a
Greek among Greeks, and was not ashamed of any of their social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>customs.</p>

<p>Passing from Solon to Phocylides, we find a somewhat different
tone of social philosophy. Phocylides was a native of Miletus
who lived between 550 and 490 B.C. If Mimnermus represents
the effeminacy of the Asiatic Greeks, Phocylides displays a kind
of prosaic worldly wisdom, for which the Ionians were celebrated.
He is thoroughly <i>bourgeois</i>, to use a modern phrase; contented
with material felicity, shrewd, safe in his opinions, and gifted with
great common-sense. Here are some of his maxims: "First get
your living, and then think of getting virtue." ... "What is the
advantage of noble birth, if favor follow not the speech and counsel
of a man?" ... "The middle classes are in many ways best
off; I wish to be of middle rank in the State." Aristotle (<i>Pol.</i>,
iv. 9, 7) quotes the last of these sayings with approbation. It is
a thoroughly Ionian sentiment. Two of his genuine fragments
contain the germ of Greek ideas afterwards destined to be widely
developed and applied by the greatest thinkers of Greece. One
of these describes the Greek conception of a perfect State: "A
small city, set upon a rock, and well governed, is better than all
foolish Nineveh." We here recognize the practical wisdom and
thorough solidity of Greek good-sense. Wealth, size, and splendor
they regarded as stumbling-blocks and sources of weakness.
To be compact and well governed expressed their ideal of social
felicity. Plato in the <i>Republic</i>, and Aristotle in the <i>Politics</i>, carry
the thought expressed in this couplet of Phocylides to its utmost
logical consequences. Again he says, "In justice the whole
of virtue exists entire." This verse, which has also been incorporated
into the elegies of Theognis, was probably the common
property of many early moralists. Aristotle quotes it in the fifth

<p>Phocylides enjoyed a high reputation among the ancients.
Though few genuine fragments of his sayings have been handed
down to us, there is a long and obviously spurious poem which
bears his name. Some moralist of the Christian period has endeavored
to claim for his half-Jewish precepts the sanction of a
great and antique authority. The greater number of those which
we may with safety accept as genuine are prefaced by the words
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8057;&#947;&#949; &#934;&#969;&#954;&#965;&#955;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#969; (and this too of Phocylides), forming an integral
part of a hexameter. Phocylides was author of an epigram
in imitation of one ascribed to Demodocus, which is chiefly
interesting as having furnished Porson with the model of his well-known
lines on Hermann. He also composed an epigrammatic
satire on women, in which he compares them to four animals, a
dog, a bee, a pig, and a horse, in the style of the poem by Simonides
of Amorgos.</p>

<p>Xenophanes, a native of Colophon, and the founder of the
Eleatic school of philosophy, has left some elegies of a gnomic
character, which illustrate another point in the Ionian intellect.
While Phocylides celebrated the superiority of comfort and the
solid goods of life, Xenophanes endeavored to break down the
prejudice in favor of mere physical advantages, and to assert the
absolute pre-eminence of intellectual power. In his second fragment
(ed. Bergk) he says, "You give all kinds of honors&mdash;precedence
at festivals, pensions, and public maintenance&mdash;to runners,
boxers, pentathletes, wrestlers, pancratists, and charioteers, who
bear away the prize at Olympia; yet these men are not so worthy
of reward as I am; for better than the strength of men or horses
is our wisdom. What is the use of all this muscular development?
It will not improve the constitution of the State or increase
the revenue."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In this paraphrase, I have, for the s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>ake of
brevity, modernized the language of Xenophanes, while seeking
to preserve the meaning of an elegy which admirably illustrates
the principles of the Ionian race, and of Athens in particular, as
contrasted with those of the Dorians. Plato, Aristotle, and all
the political moralists of Greece blamed Sparta and Thebes for
training mere soldiers and gymnasts, to the exclusion of intellectual
culture; thus retarding the growth of their constitutions
and forcing them to depend in all emergencies upon brute force.
Had all Ionians been like Solon and Xenophanes, had there been
nothing of Mimnermus or Phocylides in their character, then the
Athenians might have avoided the contrary charge of effeminacy
and ignobility of purpose and merely &aelig;sthetical superiority with
which they have been taxed.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Phocylides was Theognis, a poet of whose
gnomic elegies nearly fourteen hundred lines are still extant.
Some of these are identical with verses of Solon, and of other
writers; yet we need not suppose that Theognis was himself an
imitator. It is far more probable that all the gnomic poets borrowed
from the same sources, or embodied in their couplets maxims
of common and proverbial wisdom. That Aristotle so regarded
one of their most important aphorisms on the architectonic
supremacy of justice, we have already seen. Besides, it is not
certain on what principle the elegies which bear the names of
different poets were assigned to them. Theognis covers more
ground than any of his predecessors, and embraces a greater variety
of subjects. It has never been imagined that the fragments
we possess formed part of an elaborate and continuous poem.
They rather seem to have been written as occasion served, in order
to express the thoughts of the moment; while not a few included
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>in the canon of Theognis belong probably to other poets.
Many of them contain maxims of political wisdom, and rules for
private conduct in the choice of friends; others seem to have
been composed for the lyre, in praise of good society, or wine, or
beauty; again we find discussions of moral questions, and prayers
to the gods, mixed up with lamentations on the miseries of
exile and poverty; a few throw light upon the personal history
of Theognis; in all cases the majority are addressed to one person,
called Cyrnus.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Theognis was a noble, born at Megara about the middle of the
sixth century B.C. His city, though traditionally subject to the
yoke of Corinth, had under the influence of its aristocracy acquired
independence. In course of time Theagenes, a demagogue,
gained for himself despotical supremacy, and exiled the members
of the old nobility from Megara. He, too, succumbed to popular
force, and for many years a struggle was maintained between the
democratic party, whom Theognis persistently styles &#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#8054; and
&#948;&#949;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#8055; (bad and cowardly), and the aristocracy, whom he calls &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8054;
and &#7952;&#963;&#952;&#955;&#959;&#8055; (good and stanch). Theognis himself, as far as we
can gather from the fragments, spent a long portion of his life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>in exile from Megara; but before the period of his banishment
he occupied the position of friend and counsellor to Cyrnus, who,
though clearly younger than himself, seems to have been in some
sense leader of the Megarian aristocracy. A large number of the
maxims of Theognis on State-government are specially addressed
to him.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to examine these elegies in detail, we may
touch upon the subject of the friendship of Theognis for Cyrnus,
which has been much misunderstood. It must be remembered
that Theognis was the only Doric poet of the gnomic class&mdash;all
those who have been hitherto mentioned belonging without exception
to the Ionian family of the Greek race. We are not,
therefore, surprised to find some purely Dorian qualities in the
poetry of Theognis. Such, for instance, are the invocations to
Ph&#339;bus and Artemis, with which our collection of fragments
opens; but such, in a far more characteristic sense, is the whole
relation of the poet to his friend. From time immemorial it had
been the custom among the Dorian tribes for men distinguished
in war or State-craft to select among the youths one comrade, who
stood to them in the light of pupil and squire. In Crete this process
of election was attended with rites of peculiar solemnity, and
at Sparta the names of &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#960;&#957;&#8053;&#955;&#951;&#962; and &#7936;&#8147;&#964;&#951;&#962;, or "in-breather" and
"listener," were given to the pair. They grew up together, the
elder teaching the younger all he knew, and expecting to receive
from him in return obedience and affection. In manhood they
were not separated, but fought and sat in the assembly side by
side, and were regarded in all points as each other's representatives.
Thus a kind of chivalry was formed, which, like the modern
chivalry of love and arms, as long as it remained within due
limits, gave birth to nothing but honorable deeds and noble friendships,
but which in more degenerate days became the curse and
reproach of Hellas. There is every reason to believe t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>hat Theognis
was united to Cyrnus in the purest bonds of Doric chivalry;
and it is interesting to observe the kind of education which he
gives his friend (see 1049-1054, Theogn., ed. Bergk). Boys in
the Doric States were so soon separated from their home, and
from the training of the family, that some substitute for the parental
discipline and care was requisite. This the institution to
which I have briefly alluded seems to have to some extent supplied.
A Spartan or Cretan settlement resembled a large public
school, in which the elder boys choose their fags, and teach them
and protect them, in return for duty, service, and companionship.</p>

<p>Lines 87-100 describe the sincere and perfect affection, the
truthfulness and forbearance, which the poet requires from Cyrnus.
In another passage (1259-1270) he complains of the
changeable character of the youth, and compares him to a skittish
horse. One of his longest, and, in point of poetry, most
beautiful elegies, celebrates the immortality which his songs will
confer on Cyrnus (237-254). He tells his friend that he has
given him wings to fly with over land and sea, that fair young
men at festivals will sing of him to sweetly sounding pipes, and
that even Hades shall not prevent him from wandering on wings
of fame about the isles and land of Hellas so long as earth and
sun endure. The lofty enthusiasm and confidence of these promises
remind us of Shakespear's most pompous sonnets. Again,
he bewails the difficulties and dangers of this kind of friendship
(1353 and 1369), or entreats Cyrnus not to let malicious slanders
interrupt their intimacy. In some cases we cannot acquit Theognis
any more than Solon of licentiousness in the expression of
his love. But the general tone of his language addressed to Cyrnus
is so dignified and sober that we are inclined to think his
looser verses may refer to another and more scandalous attachment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>The first elegy of great importance (43-69) describes the state
of Megara when under the control of a democracy. It expresses
the bitter hatred and contempt which the Greek nobles in a Dorian
state felt for the Peri&#339;ci, or farmers of the neighboring
country, whom they strove to keep beneath them, and to exclude
from all political rights: "Cyrnus, this city is still a city, but the
people are all changed, who some time since knew neither law nor
justice, but wore goatskins, and dwelt like deer beyond the walls.
Now they are noble, son of Polypas; and the brave of heretofore
are base. Who can endure to look upon these things?" Again
he says (1109-1114), "The nobles of old days are now made
base, and the base are noble, ... a man of birth takes his bride
from a low man's house." In another place he complains that
the rabble rule the State with monstrous laws, that the sense of
shame has perished, and that impudence and insolence lord it
over the land (289-292). In these perilous times he compares
the State to a ship managed by incompetent and unruly mariners:
the waves are breaking over her, but the sailors prevent the good
pilot from guiding her helm, while they make pillage of the common
good (667-682). This simile bears a striking resemblance
to the passage of the <i>Republic</i> in which Plato compares a state
possessed by demagogues and the mob to an ill-governed ship.
Lastly, says Theognis, "Porters rule, and the nobles are subject
to the base." In this state of disorder the very principles of Dorian
society are neglected. Money is regarded as the charter of
nobility, and no attempts are made to maintain a generous breed
of citizens. "We are careful," he says (183-196), "to select the
best race of horses and the like, but a noble man doubts not about
marrying a mean woman if she bring him money; nor does a
woman reject the suit of a mean man if he be rich. Wealth is
honored; wealth has confused our blood." This passage has
great interest, both as showing the old prejudices of the Dorian
aristocracy, and also as proving that a new order of things was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
beginning in Greece. Even the Dorian States could not resist
the progress of commerce and republican institutions; and little
Megara, situated between mercantile Corinth and democratic Athens,
had but small strength to stem the tide. But the party of
Theognis were not always out of power. When Cyrnus and his
friends held sway in Megara, he gives them this advice (847-850):
"Trample on the empty-headed rabble; strike them with the
stinging goad; and put a galling yoke upon their neck; for never
shall you find so despot-loving a demus in the whole earth."
That he had frequent cause to apprehend the rising of some tyrant
from the body of the people may be noticed in the fragments.
Among the earliest of these in our arrangement (39-42)
occurs this elegy: "Cyrnus, this city is pregnant; but I fear that
it will bring forth a man to chastise our evil violence." He then
proceeds to lay down the axioms of the oligarchical State theory:
the nobility, he says, never ruined a city; it is only when base
leaders get the upper-hand, and wrest justice in order to indulge
the populace and make their own gain, that civil dissension and
ruin ensue. Tyrants were as hateful to the true oligarchs as a
democracy, and Theognis in one place actually advises tyrannicide:
"To lay low a despot who consumes the people is no sin,
and will not be punished by the gods" (1181). This sentiment
corresponds with the couplet of Simonides on Harmodius and
Aristogeiton, and with the apothegms of several of the sages.</p>

<p>Theognis, seeing Cyrnus environed with political difficulties,
thought fit to furnish him with rules of conduct. He was very
particular about the choice of proper friends. One elegy (31-38),
in which he discourses on the desirability of consorting with none
but the best company, and of avoiding the contagion of low comrades,
attained a wide celebrity among the Greeks. So much of
their life was spent in public, and so much of their education depended
on society, that the question of social intercourse was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of paramount importance. Plato in the <i>Meno</i>, Xenophon in his
<i>Memorabilia</i>, and Aristotle in the ninth book of the <i>Ethics</i>, all
make use of these verses: "Come not into the company of bad
men, but cling always to the good; eat and drink with them; sit
with them, and seek to please those who have great power. For
from the noble you will learn what is noble; but if you mix with
base men you will lose the wits you have." It must always be
borne in mind that by &#7952;&#963;&#952;&#955;&#959;&#8054; and &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8054; Theognis meant the men
of his own party. The "good" and "noble" were men of birth,
wealth, breeding, and power, on whom, by prejudice and habit, he
conferred these moral titles. In course of time, however, as the
words acquired a more ethical significance, the philosophers were
able to appropriate maxims of worldly prudence to their own
more elevated purposes; nor were they even in the times of Theognis
other than ambiguous, for the identification of aristocratic
position and moral worth was so conventionally complete that
words which were intended to be taken in the one sense had an
equal application in the other. In another elegy (305-308) Theognis
repeats this advice, when he observes that no one is born
utterly bad by nature, but that he contracts habits of depravity
from his associates. Here it is obvious how much of ethical
meaning the words "good" and "bad" involved, even in the
times of the Megarian poet, and how vastly important he considered
the society of well-bred companions to be in the formation
of character. A different view of moral habits seems to be taken
in another fragment (429-438), where Theognis attributes more
influence to nature than to training: "To beget and rear a child,"
he says, "is easier than to instil good principles. No one ever
devised means for making fools wise, or bad men good. If
Heaven had given to the sons of &AElig;sculapius the gift of healing
wickedness and folly, great fees would they have earned. If you
could fashion or insert what minds you liked, good men would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
never have bad sons. But no amount of teaching will make a
bad man good." These verses are quoted both by Plato and
Aristotle, with whose inquiries on the subject of Education <i>versus</i>
Nature, of &#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8052; as opposed to &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#962;, they had, of course, considerable
correspondence.</p>

<p>In connection with this subject of moral habits and companionship,
Theognis thought fit to give his pupil advice about his
deportment at the public dinners of the Dorians. At these social
meetings there was ample scope for political intrigue; and hence
it followed that a public man was forced to be particular about
his associates. The poet devotes a series of couplets (61-82) to
this point, recommending Cyrnus to be reticent, and not to communicate
the whole of his plans even to his friends. He warns
him how difficult it is to get a faithful friend. You could not
find, he says (83-86), one shipload of really trustworthy and incorruptible
men upon the face of the world. Moreover, nothing
requires more skill than to discover the insincerity of a hypocrite
(117-128). You may test gold and silver, but there are no means
of getting at the thoughts of men. This sentiment, together with
the metaphor of pinchbeck metal, is used by Euripides in <i>Medea</i>
(line 515). Aristotle also quotes the passage in his Eudemian
<i>Ethics</i> (vii. 2). Time, however, says Theognis (963-970), and
experience and calamity are the true tests of friendship. If a
man will bear misfortune with you, or will help you in a serious
undertaking, you may then, but not till then, rely upon his expressions
of attachment. This suspicious temper recalls the social
philosophy of Machiavelli; indeed, Greek politics in no respect
resembled those of modern Italy more closely than in the
diplomatic footing upon which all the relations of society were
placed. There are two very curious passages (213-218 and
1071-1074) in which Theognis bids his friend be as much as
possible all things to all men. "Turn a different side of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>your
character," he says, "to different men, and mix part of their temper
with your own. Get the nature of the cuttlefish, which looks
exactly like the rock it clings to: be versatile, and show a variety
of complexions." Again, he boasts that "among madmen I am
exceeding mad; but among the just no man is more just than
I am." Nor is this subtlety to be confined to friendly relations
merely. In one most Jesuitical couplet (363) Theognis urges his
friend "to beguile his foe with fair words; but when he has him
in his power, to take full vengeance and to spare not." As to the
actual events of the life of Cyrnus, we know nothing except what
is told us in one of the elegies (805&mdash;810), that he went as a theorus
to the shrine of Delphi. We may gather from some expressions
of the poet that he was of a rash and haughty and unconciliatory
temper.</p>

<p>Passing now to the personal history of Theognis, we are struck
with his frequent lamentations over poverty and the wretchedness
of exile. "Miserable poverty!" he cries, "go elsewhere;
prithee stay not with a host that hates thee." "Poverty breaks
the spirit of a noble man more than anything, more even than
age or ague. The poor man is gagged and bound; he cannot
speak or act.... Poverty comes not to the market or the lawsuits;
everywhere she is laughed and scoffed at, and hated by all
men, ... mother she is of helplessness; she breaks the spirit of a
man within his breast, so that he suffers shame and wrong in silence,
and learns to lie and cheat and do the sin his soul abhors....
Wretched want, why, seated on my shoulders, dost thou
debase body and mind alike" (267, 351, 385, 173-182, 649).
Wealth, on the other hand, he cries with bitterness, is omnipotent
(1117): "O wealth! of gods the fairest and most full of charm!
with thy help, though I am a mean man, I am made noble."
"Every one honors a rich man and slights a poor man: the whole
world agrees upon this point." But the finest and most satiric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>al
of all his poems on this subject is one (699-718) in which he
says: "Most men have but one virtue, and that is wealth; it
would do you no good if you had the self-control of Rhadamanthus
himself, or if you knew more wiles than Sisyphus, or if you
could turn falsehood into truth with the tongue of a Nestor, or if
you were more fleet of foot than the children of Boreas. You
must fix your mind on wealth&mdash;wealth alone. Wealth is almighty."
It was poverty that gave its bitterness to exile. My
friends, he says, pass me by; "no one is the friend or faithful
comrade of an exile. This is the sting of exile." "I have suffered
what is as bad as death, and worse than anything besides.
My friends have refused me the assistance which they owed, and
I am forced to try my foes" (811-814). Hope, which has always
been the food and sustenance of exiles, alone remained to
him. There is one beautiful elegy (1135-1150) in which he imitates
Hesiod, singing how faith and temperance and the graces
have left the earth, how oaths are broken and religion is neglected,
how holiness hath passed away; yet, if a pious man remain, let
him wait on Hope, to Hope pray always, to Hope sacrifice first
and last.</p>

<p>Verses 825-830 and 1197-1202 describe his condition while
living as a poor man, stripped of his paternal farms, in Megara.
The voice of the harvest-bird brings him sorrow, for he knows
that other men will reap his fields. How can he pipe or sing,
when from the market-place he sees his own land made the prey
of revellers? The same sense of the <i>res angusta domi</i> is expressed
in the welcome to Clearistus. We gather from another
elegy (261-266) that Theognis had lost not only his land, but
also a girl to whom he was betrothed. Her parents gave her in
marriage to a man less noble and less worthy than himself. Nor
do we fail to get some insight into his domestic circumstances.
Mr. Frere explains one fragment (271-278), full of Lear's indig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>nation,
by conjecturing that Theognis had left a wife and children
behind him at Megara during his wanderings, and had returned
to find them estranged and thankless. He translates the fragment
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One single evil, more severe and rude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than age or sickness or decrepitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dealt unequally, for him that rears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thankless offspring; in his latter years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ungratefully requited for his pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A parsimonious life and thrifty gains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With toil and care acquired for their behoof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no return! but insolent reproof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as might scare a beggar from the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wretch unknown, poor and importunate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be reviled, avoided, hated, curst;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the last of evils, and the worst!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same kind of ingenious conjecture supplies us with a plausible
explanation of some obscure couplets (1211-1216), in which
it appears that Theognis, having been taunted by a female slave,
replied by making most sarcastic remarks on the servile physiognomy,
and by boasting that among all his miseries he had remained
a free man and a noble-minded gentleman. He often
bids his soul be strong and bear bad fortune, like Ulysses when
he cried, &#964;&#8051;&#964;&#955;&#945;&#952;&#953; &#948;&#8052; &#954;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#8055;&#951; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#8059;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959; &#960;&#959;&#964;' &#7956;&#964;&#955;&#951;&#962;.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Nor does he fail to ease his heart by praying for vengeance, and indulging
the hope that he may live to drink the blood of his foes (349),
and to divide their property among his friends (562). That he
was kindly entertained in the various states he visited, he tells us;
and it is thought that he received the citizenship of Hybl&aelig;an Megara.
Sicily, Eub&#339;a, and Sparta (783-788) are specially mentioned
by him as his homes in exile. Wherever he went he carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>with him fame, and found a welcome. "Yet," says the poet,
"no joy of those fair lands entered my soul, so far was anything
from seeming dearer than my native land."</p>

<p>Among the elegies of general interest attributed to Theognis,
none is more beautiful than the following hymn to the goddesses
of Song and Beauty, which has been very elegantly rendered into
English verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Muses and Graces! daughters of high Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When erst you left your glorious seats above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bless the bridal of that wondrous pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cadmus and Harmonia fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye chanted forth a divine air:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"What is good and fair<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Shall ever be our care."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus the burden of it rang:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"That shall never be our care<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which is neither good nor fair."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such were the words your lips immortal sang.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The very essence of the Greek feeling for the beautiful is expressed
in these simple lines. Beauty, goodness, and truth were
to the Greeks almost convertible terms; and the nearest approach
which Plato made to the conception of a metaphysical deity was
called by him the &#7984;&#948;&#8051;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8166;. Not less Greek is the sentiment
expressed in the following lines (1027): "Easy among men
is the practice of wickedness, but hard, friend Cyrnus, is the
method of goodness." Theognis here expresses very prosaically
what Hesiod and Simonides have both enunciated in noble verse
(<i>Op. et Dies</i>, 285-290, and Simonides, Frag. 15, ed. Gaisford). It
is noticeable that in his couplet &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8056;&#957; is used instead of &#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8053;.
The thought, however, is the same; nor does it differ widely from
that which is contained in the Aristotelian "Hymn to Virtue,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>where we see that what the Greeks meant by this word included
not only moral rectitude, but also the labor of a Hercules, and all
noble or patriotic deeds which implied self-devotion to a great
cause.</p>

<p>The occasions for which the elegies of this class were composed
by Theognis seem to have been chiefly banquets and drinking-parties.
In the Dorian States of Greece it was customary for men to
form select clubs, which met together after the public meals for
the purpose of drinking, conversing, and enjoying music. These
friendly societies formed an appendix to the national &#966;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#8055;&#964;&#953;&#945;, or
public tables. Great care was taken in the selection of members,
who were admitted by ballot; and in time the clubs acquired political
importance. Periander is said (Aris. <i>Pol.</i>, v. 9, 2) to have
abolished them in Corinth because they proved favorable to aristocracy&mdash;no
doubt by keeping up the old Doric traditions which
he took pains to break down. In the verses of Theognis we are
introduced to many members of his club by name&mdash;Onomacritus,
Clearistus, Demonax, Democles, Timagoras, and doubtless Cyrnus.
Of course these customs were not confined to Doric cities; on the
contrary, the Symposia and Erani of the Athenians are more celebrated
for their wit and humor, while readers of Thucydides remember
how large a part the clubs played in the history of the
8th book. But the custom was systematized, like everything
else, with greater rigor among Dorians. It appears that, after
having eaten, the cups were filled and libations were made to the
Doric patron Ph&#339;bus (cf. Theogn., Frag. 1); then came the Comus,
or drinking-bout: flute-players entered the room, and some
of the guests sang to the lyre, or addressed an elegy to the company
at large, or to some particular person. These facts may be
gathered from different fragments of Theognis (997, 757); but if
we wish to gain a complete picture of one of these parties, we may
seek it in an elegy of Xenophanes, which is so fresh and pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
that I feel inclined to paraphrase it at length:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Now the floor is cleanly swept; the hands of all the guests are washed;
the cups shine brightly on the board. Woven wreaths and fragrant myrrh
are carried round by the attendants, and in the middle stands a bowl full of
that which maketh glad the heart of man. Wine, too, is ready in reserve,
wine inexhaustible, honey-sweet in jars, smelling of flowers. Frankincense
breathes forth its perfume among the revellers, and cold water, sweet and
pure, waits at their side. Loaves, fresh and golden, stand upon the table,
which groans with cheese and rich honey. In the midst is an altar hung
about with flowers, and singing and merriment resound throughout the house.
First must merry-making men address the gods with holy songs and pure
words; libations must they pour, and pray for strength to act justly; then
may they drink as much as a man can carry home without a guide&mdash;unless
he be far gone in years. This also is right, to speak of noble deeds and virtue
over our cups; not to tell tales of giants or Titans or the Centaurs, mere
fictions of our grandfathers, and foolish fables."</p></div>

<p>It was customary at these banquets to sing the praises of youth
and to lament old age, ringing endless changes on the refrain
"Vivamus atque amemus," which antiquity was never weary of
repeating. Very sad and pathetic is the tone of these old songs,
wherein the p&aelig;an mingles with the dirge; for youth and the
grave are named in the same breath, and while we smell the roses
we are reminded that they will wither. Then comes the end&mdash;the
cold and solitary tomb, eternal frost and everlasting darkness, to
which old age, the winter and night of life, is but a melancholy
portal. <i>Gaudeamus igitur, juvenes dum sumus.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To pleasure, in life's bloom, yield we our powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet to be and to enjoy are ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For swift as thought our glorious youth goes by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift as the coursers that to battle fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the chief with quivering spear in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Madly careering o'er the rich corn-land&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>
<p>so sings Theognis (977), and with even more of pathos he exclaims&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah me! my youth! alas for eld's dark day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This comes apace, while that fleets fast away.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same idea is repeated in many other elegies, always with the
same sad cadence: "No man, as soon as the earth covers him, and
he goes down to Erebus, the home of Persephone, takes any pleasure
in the sound of the lyre, or the voice of the flute-player, or in
the sweet gifts of Dionysus" (973-976). At another time he
reckons up the ills of life: "When I am drinking I take no heed
of soul-consuming poverty or of enemies who speak ill of me;
but I lament delightful youth which is forsaking me, and wail for
grim old age who cometh on apace" (1129-1132). Their tone
reminds us of Mimnermus, who said the utmost when he cried&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Zeus to Tithonus gave a grievous ill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undying age, than death more horrible!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To multiply more elegies of this description would be useless.
We may, however, allude to a poem of Simonides (Frag. 100, ed.
Gaisford), which combines the sweetness of Mimnermus and the
energy of Theognis: "Nothing human endures for aye. Well
said the bard of Chios, that like the leaves so is the race of men:
yet few who hear this keep it in their mind; for hope is strong
within the breast of youth. When the flower of youth lasts, and
the heart of a man is light, he nurses idle thoughts, hoping he
never will grow old or die; nor does he think of sickness in good
health. Fools are they who dream thus, nor know how short are
the days of youth and life. But learn thou this, and live thy life
out, cheering thy soul with good things." The tone of these elegies
pervades a great many monuments of Greek sculpture. Standing
before the Genius of Eternal Repose, or the so-called Genius
of the Vatican, we are moved almost to tears by the dumb sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>ness
with which their perfect beauty has been chastened. Like the
shade of young Marcellus in Virgil, they seem to carry round
them a cloud of gloom, impalpable, yet overshadowing their youth
with warnings and anticipations of the tomb.</p>

<p>With Theognis the list of gnomic poets, strictly so called, may
be said to close. Simonides, from whom I have adduced some
passages in illustration of the elder elegiac writers, survived the
bard of Megara, and attained a far greater reputation than he enjoyed,
at the Syracusan and Athenian courts. How highly his
maxims were valued by the moralists of the succeeding age is
known by every reader of the <i>Protagoras</i> and <i>Republic</i> of Plato.
But a more detailed analysis of his verses would be out of place,
when we consider that his chief fame rests upon epitaphs, patriotic
epigrams, and lyrical fragments&mdash;none of them strictly gnomic
in their character.</p>

<p>To modern readers the philosophy of the poets whom we have
considered will perhaps seem trite, their inspiration tame, their
style pedestrian. But their contemporaries were far from arriving
at this criticism. To obtain concise and abstract maxims upon
the ethics of society, politics, and education was to them a new
and inestimable privilege. In the gnomic poets the morality
which had been merely implicit in Homer and Hesiod received
separate treatment and distinct expression. The wisdom which
had been gradually collecting for centuries in the Greek mind
was tersely and lucidly condensed into a few pregnant sentences.
These sentences formed the data for new syntheses and higher
generalizations, the topics for enlarged investigation, the "middle
axioms" between the scattered facts of life and the unity of philosophical
system. <i>We</i> may regard the gnomic poets with interest,
partly on account of the real, if rare, beauty of some of their
fragments; partly on account of their historical and illustrative
value; partly because all efforts of the human mind in its strugg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>le
for emancipation, and all stages in its development, are worthy
of attentive study. To the sophists, to the orators, to Socrates
and his friends, to the tragic writers, to educated men at large
in Hellas, they were authorities on moral questions; and their
maxims, which the progress of the centuries has rendered commonplace,
appeared the sentences of weightiest wisdom, oracles
almost, and precepts inspired by more than human prudence.</p>

singularly, exquisitely Greek. The &aelig;sthetic tact of the Greek race felt the
plastic charm of a youth's form dead upon the battle-field. Like a statue
marbled by the frost of death he lies, the perfection of life-moulded clay;
and his red wounds are the lips of everlasting praise. Not so the elder man.
Nakedness and mutilation bring no honor to him; he has no loveliness of
shape to be revealed and heightened by the injuries of war; for him the flowing
beard and the robes of reverend eld are a majestic covering, to be withdrawn
by no hand seeking to unveil secluded beauties. His lot is cast no longer
in those fields, intense and passionate of art and love, where death, cropping
the bloom unset, confers a crown of immortality. Cf. <i>Iliad</i>, xxii. 71. An
echo of this Greek feeling for the beautiful young dead may be traced in
David's picture of the drummer-boy at Avignon, in Walt Whitman, and in

the life of Theognis from his elegies. It would be too much to assert
that his conjectures are always successful. Indeed, he often introduces foreign
matter and modern sentiment, while he neglects the peculiarly Greek relations
of the poet to his friend. Those who are curious about such works
of hypercriticism would do well to study his <i>Theognis Restitutus</i>. (Frere's
Works, vol. ii.) In doing so, they must, however, bear in mind, as already
observed above, that a great many of the couplets and short poems ascribed
to Theognis by the later Greeks were not really his own. Theognis, like Hesiod,
Solon, and Phocylides, was credited with more proverbial wisdom than
he can be held responsible for. Contradictory utterances are therefore not
unfrequent in his elegies, and this fact renders a trustworthy restoration of
his biography and body of opinion almost impossible.</p></div>

<p>The Greeks displayed their &aelig;sthetic instinct in nothing more
remarkably than in their exact adaptation of the forms of art to
the nature of the subjects which they undertook to treat. The
hexameter had sufficed for the needs of the epic. The elegiac
had fulfilled the requirements of pathetic or contemplative meditation.
But with the development of the national genius a separate
vehicle for satire was demanded. Archilochus of Paros created
a new style, and presented in the iambic metre a new instrument
to the poets of his race. The circumstances of the birth
and parentage of Archilochus are significant. He was the son of
Telesicles, a noble Ionian, and of Enipo, a slave-woman. Thus
from the very first there were inequalities in his circumstances
which may have sufficed to sour his temper. His birth, which
may be fixed about 729 B.C., was predicted, according to old tradition,
by the oracle at Delphi. The same oracle busied itself at
a later period with his death, by cursing the Naxian soldier Calondas,
who had killed him in battle, because he had "slain the servant
of the Muses." As the fragments we possess of Archilochus
render it difficult to understand the very high estimatio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>n in which
he was held by the Greeks, and which these stories indicate, it
may be well to preface this account of him with some quotations
from the ancient critics. Longinus,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> to begin with, explains the
incongruities of his poetry by saying that he "dragged disorderly
elements into his verse under the impulse of divine inspiration."
Plato<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> calls him &#8001; &#963;&#959;&#966;&#8061;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7944;&#961;&#967;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#967;&#959;&#962;, "the prince of sages,"
which, in the mouth of a philosopher, is the highest panegyric.
The Alexandrian critic Aristophanes, when asked which of the
poems of Archilochus he liked best, answered with laconic brevity,
"the longest." Hadrian,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> in an epigram, says that the Muses
turned the attention of Archilochus to mad iambics, in order that
their darling Homer might not have so dangerous a rival in the
field of the epic. All antiquity agreed in naming him second
only to Homer: "Maximus poeta aut certe summo proximus," "a
poet of the highest order, or surely next unto the greatest," says
Valerius Maximus. The birthdays of Homer and Archilochus
were celebrated on the same day; their busts were joined in Janus
fashion&mdash;two faces and one head: Hippodromus the Sophist<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
called Homer the Voice, Archilochus the Breath or Soul, of the
students of wisdom. The epithet &#954;&#8049;&#955;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; (most beautiful) was
ascribed to him because of his perfect style, though the subjects
of his poetry were anything but beautiful. Of this style Quintilian<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
says that it excelled in "powerful as well as short and quivering
sentences," that it contained "the greatest possible amount
of blood and sinews." The highest praise which Gorgias could
pronounce on Plato when he published his dialogues upon the
Sophists was to say that Athens had produced a new Archilochus.
To multiply these panegyrics would be easy. But enough has
been adduced to prove that the ancients looked on Archilochus as
a worthy rival of Homer, as a poet supreme in his own department,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>as the creator of a new kingdom in poetry, as the sire of a
long line of mighty artists.</p>

<p>What remains of the verse of Archilochus and what we know
of his life are curiously at variance with this enthusiasm. Nothing
proves the difference between ancient and modern views of
art more strongly than the fact that all antiquity concurred in regarding
as a divinely inspired benefactor of the human race a
man who in the present day would have been hunted from society
with execrations. This son of the slave-woman, born in an Ionian
island, where license was more tolerated than in a Dorian state,
devoted himself to satire, making his genius the instrument of
private hate, and turning the golden gifts of the Muses to the service
of his selfish spite. A greater contrast cannot be conceived
than that which exists between Homer, the priest of gods and heroes,
the poet of high actions and lofty passions, whose own life
is buried in sacred and sublime mystery, and this satirist who saw
the world with jaundiced eyes, prying about for subjects of his
wrath and bitterness and scorn, whose themes were the passions
of his own heart, the sordid misadventures of his personality. It
was this contrast between Archilochus and Homer that gave the
former a right in the estimation of the Greeks to take equal rank
with the father of the epos. He, the greatest poet next in date
to Homer, by virtue of a divine originality of genius, exercised his
art in exactly the opposite field to that which Homer ruled as his
demesne. Clearer sign than this of inspiration could not be demanded;
and how should posterity withhold its gratitude from
the poet who had unlocked a new chamber of the treasure-house
of art? This was how the ancients reasoned, instead of measuring
their poets, as the moderns try to do, by moral standards and conventional
conceptions of propriety.</p>

<p>The facts in the life of Archilochus are briefly these. He was
engaged to be married to Neobul&eacute;, daughter of Lycambes. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
father retracted his consent to the marriage, having possibly discovered
that the temper of his proposed son-in-law was a mixture
of gall, wormwood, vinegar, verjuice, vitriol, and nitric acid. Thereupon,
as Horace says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Archilochum proprio rabies armavit iambo.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He made the iambic metre his own, and sharpened it into a
terrible weapon of attack. Each verse he wrote was polished
and pointed like an arrow-head. Each line was steeped in the
poison of hideous charges against his sweetheart, her sisters, and
her father. The set of poems which he produced, and, as it
would appear, recited publicly at the festival of Demeter, were
so charged with wit and fire that the country rang with them.
The daughters of Lycambes, tradition avers, went straightway
and hanged themselves&mdash;unable to endure the flight of fiery serpents
that had fallen on them; for, to quote the words of Browning,
Archilochus had the art of writing verse that "bit into the
live man's flesh like parchment," that sent him wandering, branded
and forever shamed, about his native streets and fields. After
this murderous exhibition of his power, Archilochus left Paros.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away with Paros! her figs and fishy life!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He removed to Thasos, where the Parians founded a colony.
But Thasos was worse than Paros:<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> "Like the backbone of an
ass, it stood bristling with wild wood; for, in sooth, it is not a
fair land, or pleasant, or delightful, like that which spreads by
Siris's stream." It was here he threw his shield away in a battle
with the Thracians, and gave Horace and Alc&aelig;us a precedent by
writing a poem on his want of prowess. The remainder of his
life was spent in wandering. He visited Sparta, where, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>he was not suffered to remain an hour. The Ephors judged rightly
that this runaway soldier and foul-mouthed Ionian satirist
might corrupt the Spartan youth, or sow dissension in the State.
The publication of his works was forbidden in this the most
conservative of all Greek states. Finally Archilochus returned
to Paros, and was killed in battle by a native of Naxos. A more
unhappy existence, wretched in itself and the cause of wretchedness
to others, can scarcely be imagined, if the tale of the life of
Archilochus be true. Dishonored by the inequality of his parentage,
slighted in the matter of his marriage, discontented at home,
restless and rejected abroad, he seems to have been formed by the
facts of his biography for the creation of satire. And this is his
greatest title to fame.</p>

<p>It is possible that the iambic metre existed before the date of
Archilochus. An old myth connects it with the festivals of Demeter.
Demeter, it is said, could not be made to laugh after her
daughter's loss, until a nymph, Iamb&eacute;, by her jests and sarcasms,
raised a smile upon her lips. This legend proves that the Greeks
referred the origin of the iambic to those jokes and gibes which
were common in the feasts of Demeter, and from the licentious
mirth of which the satiric element of comedy was developed.
The iambic is nearest in cadence to the language of common life;
it is, therefore, the fit vehicle for dialogue, and for all poetry that
deals with common and domestic topics. Again, it is essentially
rapid in movement: Horace speaks of <i>celeres iambi</i> (swift iambi);
Hadrian calls them &#955;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#7988;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#953; (raging iambi): this
rapidity fitted them for sharp attack and swift satiric pungency.
Admitting, then, that the metre may have been employed in early
attempts at colloquial satire, Archilochus, perceiving its capacities,
fashioned it to suit the purpose of his own consummate art.
He was celebrated among the ancients for having perfected the
metres belonging to what they called the &#948;&#953;&#960;&#955;&#8049;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;, as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>distinguished
from the &#7988;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;&mdash;that is to say, the iambic and
trochaic rhythms, in which either the arsis or the thesis has twice
the time of the other. In a trochee the first syllable equals two
of the same time as the second; in an iamb this order is reversed;
whereas the dactyl and the spondee, on which the hexameter
and elegiac metres are based, are feet each member of
which has the same time, the two shorts of the dactyl being
equivalent to the second long of the spondee. Archilochus, if
not absolutely the inventor, was the creator of these two metres,
the iambic and trochaic, as truly as Homer was the creator of
the heroic measure. No proof of the power of his genius can be
greater than the fact that, whatever changes may have been subsequently
wrought in the iambic and trochaic metres, they remained
substantially the same as those which Archilochus employed,
whether afterwards adapted to satire, tragedy, or comedy.
While speaking of Archilochus as a technical artist, it ought to
be mentioned that he gave further proof of his originality by
elaborating the metrical systems which the Greeks called Asynart&ecirc;tes,
or unconnected. These consisted of a mixture of dactylic
and anap&aelig;stic with trochaic feet. The ithyphallic, which was
marked by a succession of three trochees at the end of the line,
was the most distinguished.</p>

<p>To translate Archilochus is almost impossible. His merit is
the perfection of style, which will admit of no transplantation.
His language is the language of common life, exquisitely chosen,
and kept within the most exact limits, with a view to the production
of a carefully studied effect. It is hopeless to render such
fragments as we possess without making them seem coarse or
prosy, the poet's supremacy having been achieved by his artistic
handling of vernacular Greek. When we compare its pithy terseness
with the flowing grandeur of the epic&mdash;a grandeur which
had already become conventional in Greece, a fluency wh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>ich
poetasters abused&mdash;it is easy to understand that the racy epigrams
of Archilochus, in which the subject was set forth with
exquisite point and without circumlocution, must have been an
acceptable novelty to his audience. Greek sculpture is not more
pure in outline than the following fragment,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> which sets before
our eyes the figure of a girl embossed on marble or engraved in
chalcedony:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Archilochus flourished between 714 and 676 B.C. The date
of the next iambic poet, Simonides of Amorgos, is 660 B.C. It
is noticeable that both of these satirists are Ionian. The relaxation
of Ionian life and the freedom of Ionian manners, as concerned
the artist and the public, rendered the development of
satire in Ionia more natural than it could ever have been in a
Dorian state. Simonides owes his celebrity to a poem upon
women, a very ungallant production of 119 lines, which presents
one of the most curious examples upon record of a perfectly
smooth and yet crushing satire. The iambic lines flow quietly
and swiftly off the poet's lips, in mild and polished phraseology,
with none of the concentrated fury of Archilochus. Yet Simonides
aims at no less than destroying the character of a whole sex.
In a sort of gentle, well-mannered, lazy way he is successful, not
so much by persuading us through examples, after the method of
Juvenal, that his satire is justified, as by the imperturbable expression
of a profound conviction. The interest of this poem
is very great, as marking a departure from the personalities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>Archilochus and an attempt to introduce generalities into the
region of satiric delineation. In this respect it is in Greek literature
almost unique, if we except Sicilian, Megarian, and Attic
comedy, whereof this is not the place to speak. The rhetorical
treatment of a problem of social ethics from the point of view of
satire was, as we shall see hereafter, alien to Greek literature.</p>

<p>This is the plan of the poem. Simonides describes the nature
of the different sorts of women by comparing them successively
to a hog, a fox, a dog, mud, sea-water, an ass, a weasel, a mare,
an ape, a bee. Thus there are ten kinds, and only one respectable
or industrious. He rushes at once <i>in medias res</i>: "God
made the mind of women in the beginning of different qualities:
for one he fashioned of a bristly hog; in whose house everything
tumbles about in disorder, bespattered with mud, and rolls upon
the ground: she, dirty, with unwashed clothes, sits and grows fat
in a dung-heap." The woman like mud is thus hit off: "This
woman is ignorant of everything both good and bad; her only
accomplishment is eating; cold though the winter be, she is too
stupid to draw near the fire." Here is the woman who takes after
the sea: "She has two minds; when she laughs and is glad, the
stranger seeing her at home will give her praise&mdash;there is not a
better woman than this on the earth, no, nor a fairer; but another
day she is unbearable, not to be looked at or approached,
but she is right mad. To friend and foe she is alike implacable
and odious. Thus as the sea often is calm and innocent, a great
delight to sailors in summer-time, and oftentimes again is frantic,
tearing along with roaring billows; so is this woman in her temper."
The woman who resembles a mare offers other disagreeable
qualities. She is "delicate and long-haired, unfit for drudgery
or toil: <i>she</i> would not touch the mill or lift the sieve or clean
the house out! She bathes twice or thrice a day, and smears
herself with myrrh; then she wears her hair combed out, lon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>g
and wavy, decked with flowers. It follows that this woman is a
rare sight to one's guests, but to her husband she's a curse, unless
he be a tyrant who prides himself on such expensive luxuries."
The ape-like wife is treated even worse. But at last we reach the
bee: "The man who gets her is lucky; to her alone belongs no
blame: his property thrives and increases under her; and loving
with a loving helpmate she grows old, the mother of a fair and
famous race. Such wives are the best and wisest Zeus grants to
men." Yet even after this pretty picture Simonides winds up
with a comprehensive condemnation of the female sex: "Zeus
made this supreme evil&mdash;women: even though they seem to be
of good, when one has got one, she becomes a plague."</p>

<p>The spirit of this invective is derived in a great measure from
Hesiod, whose myth of Pandora marked his estimate of women,
and whose precepts concerning the choice of a wife must have
depressed the B&#339;otian bachelors with the certainty that nine
women out of ten would prove a curse. This is precisely the
proportion of bad to good that Simonides establishes. His tenth
and virtuous wife is praised because she is industrious and quiet,
and the mother of many children. We here get the primitive
ideal of the helpmeet for man. Modern theorists would condemn
it as the model of a slave. And it is certain that, as Greek
civilization advanced, without a corresponding elevation of the
conception of wifehood, the chivalrous sentiment of the Greeks
sought other channels than that of sexual love, exalting a form of
passionate friendship between men as the real source of heroic
action and inspiring thought.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The outline traced by Simonides
was filled in by subsequent satirists. Susarion, the comic poet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>makes this grandiloquent proclamation: "Hear, O ye people!
These are the words of Susarion of Tripodiscus, Philinus's son,
of Megara: Woman is a curse!" Aristophanes in his plays the
<i>Lysistrata</i>, the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>, and the <i>Ecclesiazus&aelig;</i>, gives to
the Athenian women all the attributes of the hog, the ape, the
clay, the sea, and the fox; in the <i>Clouds</i> he draws the picture of
one who is like the old blood-mare; but he does not hint, even
by way of parody, that there existed any bees. The Greeks never
learned the art of making women their companions in the
noblest sense. It must, however, be borne in mind that the
Ionians were less civilized in this respect than the Dorians, who
had a higher regard for the excellences of women, and allowed
them greater liberty.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Simonides is expressing Ionian rather
than Dorian sentiments, and at the same time may be reasonably
supposed to be overstraining them for the sake of a burlesque
effect.</p>

<p>Next in date to Simonides among the iambographers ranks
Hipponax of Ephesus, who flourished about 540 B.C. He, too,
was an Ionian. The satire which Archilochus had directed against
private enemies was extended, as we have seen, by Simonides to a
whole sex; and thus its purely selfish character had been considerably
modified. But Hipponax restored it to its primitive
function. He used the iambic as a weapon of personal attack;
and as Archilochus had shot his arrows against Lycambes and his
daughters, so Hipponax found a butt in Bupalus and Athenis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>sculptors of Chios. These two artists had begun by ridiculing
the poet, who was short and thin and ugly. They seem to have
made caricatures of him, piquing themselves, no doubt, upon the
durability of the marble in which they worked. But they found
more than their match in Hipponax, whose biting verses are said
to have driven Bupalus to hang himself. Whether this is a mere
echo of the tale of Lycambes remains doubtful; but, at any rate,
the statues of the sculptor have perished, while the poet's iambics
exist in sufficient force to justify his reputation among the
ancients for having been the most caustic, crabbed, and sour of
satirists. They called him &#8001; &#960;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#8057;&#962; (the pungent), and in their
epigrams made merry over his traditional bad temper. Leonidas
of Tarentum, for instance, warns travellers not to touch his tomb,
lest they should rouse the sleeping wasp; and Alc&aelig;us of Messene
says that no ivy, vine, or rose should adorn his grave, but only
thorns and thistles.</p>

<p>In order apparently to bring the metre still more within the
sphere of prose and common speech, Hipponax ended his iambics
with a spondee or a trochee instead of an iambus, doing thus the
utmost violence to the rhythmical structure. These deformed
and mutilated verses were called &#967;&#969;&#955;&#8055;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#953; or &#7988;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#953; &#963;&#954;&#8049;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;
(lame or limping iambics). They communicate a curious crustiness
to the style. The choliambi are in poetry what the dwarf
or cripple is in human nature. Here again, by their acceptance
of this halting metre, the Greeks displayed their acute &aelig;sthetic
sense of propriety, recognizing the harmony which subsists between
crabbed verses and the distorted subjects with which they
dealt&mdash;the vices and perversions of humanity&mdash;as well as their
agreement with the snarling spirit of the satirist. Deformed
verse was suited to deformed morality. Meanwhile it is but
just to Hipponax to record that he appears to have been a sincere
castigator of crime, extravagance, and folly. Without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
sublime perfection and fervid energy of Archilochus, he does
not seem to have shared the unamiable personal qualities of the
greater poet. Two of his lines give a sufficient notion of his
style:</p>

</div></div>

<p>A woman gives two days of happiness to man, in her bridal and
her burial.</p>

<p>The satire which these three Ionians, Archilochus, Simonides,
and Hipponax, inaugurated in Greece was continued by the Attic
comic poets. Satire in the Roman and the modern sense of the
term never flourished among the Greeks. The life of the Agora,
the Ecclesia, and the Theatre was too complete and free to need
the supplement of rhetorical invective intended either for reading
or for recitation. Of satirical comments upon individuals and of
pasquinades of every kind the Greeks had plenty. We hear, for
example, that Alc&aelig;us exercised his poetical talent in satirizing
Pittacus, and one of the most considerable fragments of Anacreon
contains a very ludicrous caricature of Artemon, his rival for the
affections of a certain yellow-haired Eurypyle. But their satire
did not incline to the form which the earlier writers of iambics
had invented. It found its true sphere in the Dorian comedy of
Epicharmus and the Athenian comedy of Aristophanes, who combined
the personalities of Archilochus and the generalities of Simonides
in his own consummate work of dramatic art. Among
the lost treasures of Greek literature we have to regret few things
more than the plays of the Syracusan Epicharmus, from whom
we might have learned directly what now we can only infer&mdash;that
the Dorians, when uncontrolled by the severe taste of Sparta,
indulged a humor for drollery and sarcasm, which, though
rougher than that of the Ionians, must have had its own flavor
of raciness and fun. Roman satire maintained a strictly moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
intention; <i>facit indignatio versus</i> is the motto of Juvenal, while
Horace holds the mirror of worldly philosophy to the follies and
the vices of his age, and Persius applies the canons of Stoical
ethics to the phenomena of society as he observed them. This
is the lead which our modern satirists&mdash;the Regnier of France,
the Dryden or the Pope of England, have followed. Greek literature
furnishes no specimen of this species of composition.
Wherever in the Comedies of Aristophanes, or the Dialogues of
Lucian, or the Epigrams of the Anthology, we meet with satire,
we find the simple motives of Archilochus and Simonides at
work. Personal animosity gives a barb and a venom to the
shaft; or the poet delineates with more or less of comic wit
the social anomalies that have struck his fancy. Of serious invective
and of moral preaching, the Greeks, in their satiric art
at least, knew nothing. Plato himself is only accidentally a satirist
in the sense of the term which we moderns have adopted
from the Romans.</p>

worst faults of the Greek race. Yet it is easy to overestimate the importance
of such satires as that of Simonides; nor would it be fair to take them

nobler place in social life to women, ascribed the fall of man to Eve. Modern
literature again, in spite of Christianity and chivalry, is not wanting in epigrams

<p>To compress into a single essay all that should be said about
the Greek lyrical poets is impossible. Yet by eliminating the
writers of elegies and iambics, who have been considered separately
as gnomic poets and satirists, the field is somewhat narrowed.
Simonides of Amorgos, Archilochus, Theognis, Solon,
not to mention lesser names, are by this process legitimately excluded.
The &AElig;olian lyrists, with Sappho at their head, and the
so-called Dorian lyrists, who culminate in Pindar, remain. Casting
a glance backward into the remote shadows of antiquity, we
find that lyrical poetry, like all art in Greece, took its origin in
connection with primitive Nature-worship. The song of Linus,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
referred to by Homer in his description of the shield of Achilles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>was a lament sung by reapers for the beautiful dead youth who
symbolized the decay of summer's prime.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> In the funeral chant
for Adonis, women bewailed the fleeting splendor of the spring;
and Hyacinthus, loved and slain by Ph&#339;bus, whom the Laconian
youths and maidens honored, was again a type of vernal loveliness
defloured. The Bacchic songs of alternating mirth and
sadness, which gave birth, through the dithyramb, to tragedy,
and through the Comus-hymn to comedy, marked the waxing
and the waning of successive years, the pulses of the heart of
Nature, to which men listened as the months passed over them.
In their dim beginnings these elements of Greek poetry are hardly
to be distinguished from the dirges and the raptures of Asiatic
ceremonial, in which the dance and chant and song were mingled
in a vague monotony&mdash;generation after generation expressing the
same emotions according to traditions handed down from their
forefathers. But the Greek genius was endowed with the faculty
of distinguishing, differentiating, vitalizing, what the Oriental nations
left hazy and confused and inert. Therefore with the very
earliest stirrings of conscious art in Greece we remark a powerful
specializing tendency. Articulation succeeds to mere interjectional
utterance. Separate forms of music and of metre are devoted,
with the unerring instinct of a truly &aelig;sthetic race, to the expression
of the several moods and passions of the soul. An unconscious
psychology leads by intuitive analysis to the creation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>distinct branches of composition, each accurately adapted to its
special purpose.</p>

<p>From the very first commencement of their literature, the
Greeks thus determined separate styles and established critical
canons, which, though empirically and spontaneously formed,
were based on real relations between the moral and &aelig;sthetical
sides of art, between feeling and expression, substance and form.
The hexameter was consecrated to epical narrative; the elegy was
confined to songs of lament or meditation; the iambic assumed a
satiric character. To have written a narrative in iambics or a satire
in hexameters would have been odious to Greek taste; the
stately march of the dactylic metre seemed unfit for snarling and
invective; the quick flight of the iambic did not carry weight
enough or volume to sustain a lengthy narrative. In the same
way the infinite divisions of lyrical poetry had all their own peculiar
properties. How could a poet have bewailed his loves or
losses in the stately structure of the Pindaric ode? Conversely,
a hymn to Ph&#339;bus required more sonorousness and elaboration
than the recurring stanzas of the Sapphic or Alcaic offered. It
was the business, therefore, of the Greek poet, after duly considering
his subject, to select the special form of poetry consecrated
by long usage for his particular purpose; to conform his language
to some species of music inseparable from that style, and then,
within the prescribed limits, both of metre and of melody, to exercise
his imagination as freely as he could, and to produce novelty.
This amount of fixity in the forms of poetry and music
arose from the exquisite tact and innate taste of the Greek race.
It was far from being a piece of scholastic pedantry or of Chinese
conservatism. No; the diction, metre, and music of an elegy
or an ode tended to assume a certain form as naturally as the
ingredients of a ruby or a sapphire crystallize into a crimson or
an azure stone. The discrimination shown by the Greeks in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the technicalities of art remained in full vigor till the decline of
their literature. It was not until the Alexandrian age that they
began to confound these delicate distinctions, and to use the idyllic
hexameter for all subjects, whether narrative, descriptive, elegiac,
encomiastic, hymeneal.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Then, and not till then, the Greeks
descended to that degradation of art which prevailed, for instance,
in England during what we call the classic period of our literature.
Under the influence of Dryden and of Pope, an English poet used
no metre but the heroic couplet, whether he were writing a play,
an epigram, a satire, an epic, an eclogue, an elegy, or a didactic
epistle; thus losing all elasticity of style, all the force which appropriate
form communicates to thought.</p>

<p>To catalogue the minute subdivisions of the art of lyric poetry
in Greece, to show how wisely their several limits were prescribed,
how firmly adhered to, and to trace the connection of choral song
with all the affairs of public and private life, would be a task of
some magnitude. Colonel Mure, in a well-known passage, writes:
"From Olympus down to the workshop or the sheep-fold, from
Jove and Apollo to the wandering mendicant, every rank and degree
of the Greek community, divine or human, had its own proper
allotment of poetical celebration. The gods had their hymns,
nomes, p&aelig;ans, dithyrambs; great men had their encomia and epinikia;
the votaries of pleasure their erotica and symposiaca; the
mourner his threnoi and elegies; the vine-dresser had his epilenia;
the herdsmen their bucolica; even the beggar his eiresione
and chelidonisma." Lyrical poetry in Greece was not produced,
like poetry in modern times, for the student, by men who find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>they have a taste for versifying. It was intimately intertwined
with actual life, and was so indispensable that every town had its
professional poets and choruses, just as every church in Europe
now has its organist, of greater or less pretension. The mass of
lyrical poetry which must have existed in Greece was probably
enormous. We can only compare it to the quantity of church
music that exists in Germany and Italy, in MS. and print, good,
bad, and indifferent, unknown and unexplored, so voluminous that
no one ventures to sift it or reduce it to order. Of this large
mass we possess the fragments. Just as the rocky islands of the
&AElig;gean Archipelago testify to the existence of a submerged tract
of mountain heights and valleys, whose summits alone appear
above the waves, so the odes of Pindar, the waifs and strays of
Sappho, Simonides, and others, are evidences of the loss we have
sustained. They prove that beneath the ocean of time and oblivion
remain forever buried stores of poetry which might have been
sufficient to form the glory of a literature less rich in masterpieces
than the Greek. To collect the fragments, to piece them together,
to ponder over them until their scattered indications offer some
suggestion of the whole which has been lost, is all that remains
for the modern student. Like the mutilated marbles of Praxiteles,
chips broken off from bass-reliefs and statues, which are disinterred
from the ruins of Rome or Herculaneum, the minutest portions
of the Greek lyrists have their value. We must be thankful
for any two words of Sappho that survive in authentic juxtaposition,
for any hemistich that may be veritably styled a relic of
"some tender-hearted scroll of pure Simonides."</p>

<p>Chance has wrought fantastically with these relics. The lyrists,
even in classical days, fell comparatively early into neglect.
They were too condensed in language, too difficult in style, too sublime
in imagination for the pedants of the later empire. Long before
its close, Greek literature was oppressed with its own weal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>th;
in the words of Livy, <i>magnitudine laboravit sua</i>. Taste, too, began
to change; sophistic treatises, idyllic verses, novelettes in
prose, neat epigrams, usurped upon the grander forms of composition.
The stagnation, again, of civic life under imperial sway
proved unfavorable to the composition of national odes and to choric
celebrations in which whole peoples took a part. So disdainful
in her alms-giving has Fortune been, that she has only flung to us
the epinikian odes of Pindar; while his hymns to the gods, his
processional chants, and his funeral dirges, are lost. Young Athens,
Alexandria, and Byzantium cared, we may conceive, for poems
which shed lustre on athletic sports and horse-racing. Trainers,
boxers, riders, chariot-drivers&mdash;all the muscular section of the public&mdash;had
some interest in by-gone Pythian or Olympian victories.
But who sought to preserve the antiquated hymns to Ph&#339;bus and
to Zeus, when the rites of Isis and Serapis and the Phrygian mother
were in vogue? The outspoken boldness of the erotic and satiric
lyrists stood them in bad stead. When Theodora was exhibiting
her naked charms in the arena, who could commend the
study of Anacreon in the school-room? Degeneracy of public
morals and prudery of literary taste go not unfrequently together.
Therefore, the Emperor Julian proscribed Archilochus; and
what Julian proscribed, the Christians sought to extirpate. To
destroy an ode of Sappho was a good work. Consequently, we
possess no complete edition of even a section of the works of
any lyrist except Pindar: what remains of the others has been
preserved in the works of critics, anecdote-mongers, and grammarians;
who cite tantalizing passages to prove a rule in syntax, to
illustrate a legend or a custom, to exemplify a canon of taste.
Imbedded in ponderous prose, these splintered jewels escaped the
iconoclastic zeal of the monks. Thanks be to Athen&aelig;us above
all men (the author of an imaginary dialogue in fifteen bulky
books on every topic of Greek antiquity), to Longinus, to Phi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>lostratus,
to Maximus Tyrius, to Plutarch the moralist, to Stob&aelig;us,
to Heph&aelig;stion, to Herodian, and to the host of other Dryasdusts
from whose heaps of shot rubbish Bergk and his predecessors
have sorted out the fragments of extinguished stars! As a masterpiece
of patient, self-denying, scientific, exhaustive investigation,
the three volumes of Bergk are unrivalled. Every author
of antiquity has been laid under contribution, subjected to critical
analysis, compared and confronted with his fellow-witnesses.
The result, reduced to the smallest possible compass, yields a
small glittering heap of pure gold-dust, a little handful of auriferous
deposit sifted from numberless river-beds, crushed from
huge masses of unfertile quartz. In our admiration of the scholar's
ingenuity, we almost forget our sorrow for so much irreparable
waste.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to consider the justice of the time-honored
division of Greek lyrics into &AElig;olian and Dorian, it will be well
to pass in review a few of the principal classes into which Greek
choral poetry may be divided. Only thus can any idea of its
richness and variety be formed. The old Homeric &#8021;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#953;, or
hymns dedicated to special deities, were intended to be sung at
festivals and rhapsodical contests. Their technical name was proemia,
or preludes&mdash;preludes, that is, to a longer recitation; and
on this account, as they were chanted by the poet himself, they
were written in hexameters. With them, therefore, we have nothing
here to do. Processional hymns, or prosodia, on the contrary,
were strictly lyrical, and constituted a large portion of the
poetry of Pindar, Alcman, and Stesichorus. They were sung at
solemn festivals by troops of men and maidens walking, crowned
with olive, myrtle, bay, or oleander, to the shrines. Their style
varied with the occasion and the character of the deity to whom
they were addressed. When Hecuba led her maidens in dire necessity
to the shrine of Pallas, the prosodion was solemn and earne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>st.
When Sophocles, with lyre in hand, headed the chorus
round the trophy of Salamis, it was victorious and martial. If
we wish to present to our mind a picture of these processional
ceremonies, we may study the frieze of the Parthenon preserved
among the Elgin Marbles. Those long lines of maidens and
young men, with baskets in their hands, with flowers and palm-branches,
with censers and sacred emblems, are marching to the
sound of flutes and lyres, and to the stately rhythms of antiphonal
chanting. When they reach the altar of the god, a halt is
made; the libations are poured; and now the music changes to a
solemn and spondaic measure&mdash;for the term spondaic seems to be
derived from the fact that the libation-hymn was composed in a
grave and heavy metre of full feet. Heph&aelig;stion has preserved a
spondaic verse of Terpander which illustrates this rhythm:</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the age of Greek decadence the honors of the prosodion
were sometimes paid to men. Athen&aelig;us gives this lively description
of the procession which greeted Demetrius Poliorketes:
"When Demetrius returned from Leucadia and Corcyra to Athens,
the Athenians received him not only with incense and garlands
and libations, but they even sent out processional choruses,
and greeted him with ithyphallic hymns and dances: stationed
by his chariot-wheels, they sang and danced and chanted that he
alone was a real god; the rest were sleeping, or were on a journey,
or did not exist; they called him son of Poseidon and Aphrodite,
eminent for beauty, universal in his goodness to mankind; then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>they prayed and besought and supplicated him like a god." The
hymn which they sang may be read in Bergk, vol. iii. p. 1314.
It is one of the most interesting relics of antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>For the sake of its rare and curious metre alternating the iambic

<p>A special kind of prosodia were the Parthenia, or processional
hymns of maidens; such, for example, as the Athenian girls sang
to Pallas while they climbed the staircase of the Parthenon. Aristophanes
has presented us with a beautiful example of antiphonal
Parthenia at the end of his <i>Lysistrata</i>, where choruses of Athenian
and Spartan girls sing turn and turn about in rivalry. Alcman
won his laurels at Sparta by the composition of this kind of
hymn. A fragment (Bergk, p. 842) only remains to show what
they were like: "No more, ye honey-voiced, sweet-singing maidens,
can my limbs support me: oh, oh, that I were a cerylus, who
skims the flower of the sea with halcyons, of a dauntless heart,
the sea-blue bird of spring!" Such Parthenia, when addressed to
Ph&#339;bus, were called Daphnephorica; for the maidens carried laurel-branches
to his shrine. A more charming picture cannot be
conceived than that which is presented to our fancy by these
white-robed virgins, each with her rod of bay and crown of laurel-leaves,
ascending the marble steps of the temple of the Dorian
god. John Lyly, who had imbibed the spirit of Greek life, has
written a hymn, "Sing to Apollo, god of day!" which might well
have been used at such a festival.</p>

<p>The prosodia of which we have been speaking were addressed
to all the gods. But there were other choric hymns with sp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>ecial
names, consecrated to the service of particular deities. Of this
sort was the p&aelig;an, sung to Ph&#339;bus in his double character of a
victorious and a healing god. The p&aelig;an was both a song of war
and of peace; it was the proper accompaniment of the battle and
the feast. In like manner the hyporchem, which, as its name implies,
was always accompanied by a dance, originally formed a portion
of the cult of Ph&#339;bus. The chorus described in the <i>Iliad</i>,
xviii. 590, and the glorious pageant of Olympus celebrated in the
<i>Hymn to Apollo</i>, 186, were, technically speaking, hyporchems.
As the p&aelig;an and the hyporchem were originally consecrated to
Apollo, so the dithyramb and the phallic hymn belonged to Dionysus.
The dithyramb never lost the tempestuous and enthusiastic
character of Bacchic revelry; but in time it grew from being
a wild celebration of the mystic sufferings of Bacchus into
the sublime art of tragedy. Arion forms the point of this transition.
He seems to have thrown a greater reality of passion and
dramatic action into his choruses, which led to the introduction
of dialogue, and so by degrees to tragedy proper. Meanwhile
the dithyramb, as a tumultuous choric song, retained its individual
existence. As Arion had devoted his genius to the cultivation of
the tragic or cyclic chorus, Lasos, the master of Pindar, stamped
his own style upon the dithyrambic ode as it continued to be
used at festive meetings. Every town in Greece had its chorodidascalus,
a functionary whom Aristophanes ridicules in the person
of Kinesias in the <i>Birds</i>.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> He is introduced warbling the
wildest, windiest nonsense, and entreating to have a pair of wings
given him that he may chase his airy ideas through the sky. The
phallic hymn, from which in like manner comedy took its origin,
was a mad outpouring of purely animal exultation. Here
the wine-god was celebrated as the pleasure-loving, drunken, lascivious
deity. Aristophanes, again, our truest source of information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>respecting all the details of Greek life, supplies us with an instance
of one of these songs, and of the simple rites which accompanied
its performance.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> In the <i>Frogs</i>, also, the Master of Comedy
has presented us with an elaborate series of Bacchic hymns.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Here the phallic and satyric element is combined with something
of the grandeur of the dithyrambic ode; the curious mixture of
sarcasm, obscenity, and splendid poetry offers a striking instance
of Greek religious feeling, so incomprehensible to modern minds.
It is greatly to be regretted that our information respecting the
dithyramb and the phallic chorus has to be obtained from a dramatic
poet rather than from any perfect specimens of these compositions.
Bergk's Collection, full as it is, yields nothing but hints
and fragments.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Passing to the lyrics, which were connected with circumstances
of human life, the first to be mentioned are epinikia, or odes sung
in honor of victors at the games. Of these, in the splendid series
of Pindar and in the fragments of Simonides, we have abundant
examples. We are also able to trace their development from the
simple exclamation of &#964;&#8053;&#957;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#945; &#8038; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#8055;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#949;,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> the composition of
which was ascribed to Archilochus, and which Pindar looked back
upon with scornful triumph. Indeed, in his hands, to use the
phrase of Wordsworth, "the thing became a trumpet, whence he
blew soul-animating strains." The epinikian ode was the most
costly and splendid flower in the victor's wreath. Pindar compares
the praise which he pours forth for Diagoras the Rhodian
to noblest wine foaming in the golden goblet, which a father gives
to honor his son-in-law, the prime and jewel of his treasure-house.</p>

<p>The occasions on which such odes were sung were various&mdash;either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>when the victor was being crowned, or when he was returning to
his native city, or by torchlight during the evening of the victorious
day, or at a banquet after his reception in his home. On one
of these occasions the poet would appear with his trained band of
singers and musicians, and, taking his stand by the altar of the
god to whom the victor offered a thanksgiving sacrifice, would
guide the choric stream of song through strophe and antistrophe
and epode, in sonorous labyrinths of eulogy and mythological allusion&mdash;prayer,
praise, and admonition mingling with the fumes
of intoxicating poetry. Of all these occasions the most striking
must have been the commemoration of a victory in the temple of
Zeus at Altis, near Olympia, by moonlight. The contest has taken
place during the day; and the olive-wreath has been placed upon
the head, say, of Myronides, from Thebes. Having rested from
his labors, after the bath and the banquet, crowned with his victorious
garland and with fillets bound about his hair, he stands
surrounded by his friends. Zeus, in ivory and gold, looks down
from his marble pedestal. Through the open roof shines a moon
of the south, glancing aslant on statue and column and carved
bass-relief; while below, the red glare of torches, paling its silver,
flickers with fitful crimson on the glowing faces of young men.
Then swells the choral hymn, with praise of Myronides and praise
of Thebes, and stormy flights of fancy shooting beyond sun and
stars. At its close follow libation, dedication, hands upraised in
prayer to Zeus. Then the trampling of sandalled feet upon the
marble floor, the procession with songs still sounding to the temple-gate,
and on a sudden, lo! the full moon, the hills and plain
and solemn night of stars. The band disperses, and the Comus
succeeds to the thanksgiving.</p>

<p>As a contrast to the epinikia we may take the different kinds
of threnoi, or funeral songs. The most primitive was called
epikedeion, a dirge or coronach, improvised by women over t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>he
bodies of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The lamentations of Helen and Andromache
for Hector, and of the slave-girls for Patroclus, are Homeric
instances of this species. Euripides imitates them in his tragedies&mdash;in
the dirge sung by Antigone, for instance, in the <i>Ph&#339;niss&aelig;</i>,
and in the wailings of Hecuba for Astyanax in the <i>Troades</i>.
A different kind of threnos were the songs of Linus, Hyacinth,
Adonis, and others, to which I have already alluded in the beginning
of this chapter. The finest extant specimen of this sort is
Bion's <i>Lament for Adonis</i>, which, however, was composed in the
idyllic age, when the hexameter had been substituted for the richer
and more splendid lyric metres. A third class of threnos consisted
of complex choral hymns composed by poets like Simonides
or Pindar, to be sung at funeral solemnities. Many of our most
precious lyric fragments, those which embody philosophical reflections
on life and dim previsions of another world, belong to dirges
of this elaborate kind.</p>

<p>Marriage festivals offered another occasion for lyric poetry.
The hymeneal, sung during the wedding ceremony, the epithalamium,
chanted at the house of the bridegroom, and many other
species, have been defined by the grammarians. Unfortunately
we possess nothing but the merest <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of any true Greek ode of
this kind. Sappho's are the best. We have to study the imitations
of her style in Catullus, the marriage chorus at the end of
the <i>Birds</i> of Aristophanes, and the epithalamium of Helen by
Theocritus, in order to form a remote conception of what a Sapphic
marriage chorus might have been. In banquet songs we are
more fortunate. Abundant are the par&#339;nia of Alc&aelig;us, Anacreon,
Theognis, and others. Scolia, or catches, so called from their irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>metrical structure, were also in vogue at banquets; and
of these popular songs a sufficient number are preserved. A
drunken passage in the works of Aristophanes brings before us
after a lively fashion the ceremonies with which the scolion and
the wine-cup circled the symposium together.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Of all these catches
the most celebrated in ancient days was the panegyric of Harmodius
and Aristogeiton, attributed to Callistratus. As I have
the opportunity of printing from MS. a translation of this song
by the late Professor Conington, I will introduce it here:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The whole collection of scolia in Bergk (pp. 1287-1296) is full
of interest, since these simple and popular songs carry us back
more freshly than elaborate poems to the life of the Greeks. One
of these, attributed to Simonides, sums up the qualities which a
Greek most desired:</p>

<p>Unlike Solomon, when asked what he would take from the
Lord as a gift, the Greek poet does not answer Wisdom, but first
Health, secondly Beauty, thirdly Wealth untainted by fraud, and
fourthly Youth in the society of friends. The last thought of
this little poem is expanded very beautifully in another scolion:</p>

<p>"Drink with me, be young with me, love with me, wear crowns

kind is the scolion of Hybrias the Cretan, translated thus
into English verse by Thomas Campbell:</p>

<span class="i4">To call me king and lord.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This catch brings before our eyes in a very lively picture the
lawless Freiherr of early Dorian barbarism. Another species of
the scolion is more sentimental: "Would that I were a fair lyre
of ivory, and that fair boys bore me to the Bacchic Choir; would
that I were a fair, new, and mighty golden jar, and that a fair
woman bore me with a pure heart." Again, we find moral precepts
in these catches. "Whoso betrayeth not a friend hath great
honor among men and gods, according to my mind."</p>

<p>While on the subject of scolia, it will not do to pass over the
most splendid specimen we have in this order of composition. It
is a fragment from Pindar (Bergk, p. 327), to translate which, I
feel, is profanation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Of the many different kinds of lyric poetry consecrated to love
and intended for recitation by single musicians, it is not possible
to give a strict account. That the Greeks cultivated the serenade
is clear from a passage in the <i>Ecclesiazus&aelig;</i> of Aristophanes,
which contains a graceful though gross specimen of this kind of
song. The children's songs (Bergk, 1303-1307) about flowers,
tortoises, and hobgoblins are too curiously illustrative of Greek
manners not to merit a passing notice, nor can I here omit a
translation of the only Swallow-song preserved to us. Athen&aelig;us,
to whom we owe this curious relic, localizes the Chelidonisma in
Rhodes, referring it particularly to the district of Lindus.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In
spring time the children went round the town, collecting doles
and presents from house to house, and singing as they went:</p>

<p>After this lengthy, but far from exhaustive, enumeration of the
kinds and occasions of lyrical poetry in Greece, we may turn to
consider the different parts played in their cultivation by the
several chief families of Hellas. It is remarkable that all the
great writers of elegies and iambics were Ionians; Theognis of
Megara is the only Dorian whose genuine poems are celebrated;
and against his we have to set the bulk of Solon, Mimnermus,
Phocylides, Callinus, and Tyrt&aelig;us, all Ionians.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Not a single
Dorian poet seems to have composed iambics, the rigid discipline
and strong sense of decorum in a Dorian state probably rendering
the cultivation of satire impossible. We are told that the Spartans
would not even suffer Archilochus to lodge as a stranger
among them. But when we turn to lyric poetry&mdash;to the poetry
of stanzas and strophes&mdash;the two other families of the Greeks, the
&AElig;olians and the Dorians, take the lead. As a Dorian was exceptional
among the elegists, so now an Ionian will be comparatively
rare among the lyrists. So great was the &aelig;sthetical conservatism
of the Greeks that throughout their history their primitive distinctions
of dialect are never lost sight of. When the Athenians
developed tragedy, they wrote their iambics in pure Attic, but
they preserved a Dorian tone in their choruses. The epic hexameter
and the elegy, on the other hand, retained an Ionian character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>to the last.</p>

<p>The paths struck out by the &AElig;olians and Dorians in the domain
of lyric poetry were so different as to justify us in speaking
of two distinct species. When Milton in the <i>Paradise Regained</i>
catalogued the poetical achievements of the Greeks, he assigned
their true place to these two species in the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&AElig;olian charms and Dorian lyric odes.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poets and poetesses of the &AElig;gean Islands cultivated a
rapid and effusive style, polishing their passionate stanzas so exquisitely
that they well deserve the name of charms. The Dorian
poets, inspired by a graver and more sustained imagination, composed
long and complex odes for the celebration of gods and heroes.
The &AElig;olian singer dwelt on his own joys and sorrows;
the Dorian bard addressed some deity, or told the tales of demigods
and warriors. The &AElig;olian chanted his stanzas to the lyre
or flute; the Dorian trained a chorus, who gave utterance to his
verse in dance and song.</p>

<p>Though the &AElig;olians were the eldest family of the Hellenic
stock, their language retaining more than any other dialect the
primitive character of the Greek tongue, yet they never rose to
such historical importance as the Dorians and Ionians. Geographically
they were scattered in such a way as to have no definite
centre. We find &AElig;olians in Elis, in B&#339;otia, in Lesbos, and
on the Asian sea-coast south of the Troad. But in course of
time the &AElig;olians of Elis and B&#339;otia were almost identified with
the Dorians as allies of Sparta, while the &AElig;olians of Lesbos and
Asia merged themselves in the Athenian empire. Politically,
mentally, and morally, they showed less activity than their cousins
of the blood of Dorus and Ion. They produced no law-givers
like Lycurgus and Solon; they had no metropolis like Sparta and
Athens; they played no prominent part in the struggle with Pers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>ia,
or in the Peloponnesian war. In the later days of Greece,
Thebes, when Dorized by contact with the Spartans, for a short
time headed Greece, and flourished with brief splendor. But it
would not be accurate to give to the &AElig;olian character the credit
of the fame of Thebes at that advanced period. Yet, for a certain
space of time, the &AElig;olians occupied the very foreground of
Greek literature, and blazed out with a brilliance of lyrical splendor
that has never been surpassed. There seems to have been
something passionate and intense in their temperament, which
made the emotions of the Dorian and the Ionian feeble by comparison.
Lesbos, the centre of &AElig;olian culture, was the island of
overmastering passions: the personality of the Greek race burned
there with a fierce and steady flame of concentrated feeling.
The energies which the Ionians divided between pleasure, politics,
trade, legislation, science, and the arts, and which the Dorians
turned to war and state-craft and social economy, were restrained
by the &AElig;olians within the sphere of individual emotions, ready
to burst forth volcanically. Nowhere in any age of Greek history,
or in any part of Hellas, did the love of physical beauty, the
sensibility to radiant scenes of nature, the consuming fervor of
personal feeling, assume such grand proportions and receive so
illustrious an expression as they did in Lesbos. At first this passion
blossomed into the most exquisite lyrical poetry that the
world has known: this was the flower-time of the &AElig;olians, their
brief and brilliant spring. But the fruit it bore was bitter and
rotten. Lesbos became a byword for corruption. The passions
which for a moment had flamed into the gorgeousness of art,
burning their envelope of words and images, remained a mere
furnace of sensuality, from which no expression of the divine in
human life could be expected. In this the Lesbian poets were
not unlike the Proven&ccedil;al troubadours, who made a literature of
love, or the Venetian painters, who based their art upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
beauty of color, the voluptuous charms of the flesh. In each
case the motive of enthusiastic passion sufficed to produce a
dazzling result. But as soon as its freshness was exhausted
there was nothing left for art to live on, and mere decadence
to sensuality ensued.</p>

<p>Several circumstances contributed to aid the development of
lyric poetry in Lesbos. The customs of the &AElig;olians permitted
more social and domestic freedom than was common in Greece.
&AElig;olian women were not confined to the harem like Ionians, or
subjected to the rigorous discipline of the Spartans. While mixing
freely with male society, they were highly educated, and accustomed
to express their sentiments to an extent unknown elsewhere
in history&mdash;until, indeed, the present time. The Lesbian
ladies applied themselves successfully to literature. They formed
clubs for the cultivation of poetry and music. They studied the
arts of beauty, and sought to refine metrical forms and diction.
Nor did they confine themselves to the scientific side of art. Unrestrained
by public opinion, and passionate for the beautiful,
they cultivated their senses and emotions, and indulged their
wildest passions. All the luxuries and elegances of life which
that climate and the rich valleys of Lesbos could afford were at
their disposal; exquisite gardens, where the rose and hyacinth
spread perfume; river-beds ablaze with the oleander and wild
pomegranate; olive-groves and fountains, where the cyclamen and
violet flowered with feathery maiden-hair; pine-tree-shadowed
coves, where they might bathe in the calm of a tideless sea;
fruits such as only the southern sun and sea-wind can mature;
marble cliffs, starred with jonquil and anemone in spring, aromatic
with myrtle and lentisk and samphire and wild rosemary
through all the months; nightingales that sang in May; temples
dim with dusky gold and bright with ivory; statues and frescos
of heroic forms. In such scenes as these the Lesbian poets liv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>ed,
and thought of love. When we read their poems, we seem to
have the perfumes, colors, sounds, and lights of that luxurious
land distilled in verse. Nor was a brief but biting winter wanting
to give tone to their nerves, and, by contrast with the summer,
to prevent the palling of so much luxury on sated senses.
The voluptuousness of &AElig;olian poetry is not like that of Persian
or Arabian art. It is Greek in its self-restraint, proportion, tact.
We find nothing burdensome in its sweetness. All is so rhythmically
and sublimely ordered in the poems of Sappho that supreme
art lends solemnity and grandeur to the expression of unmitigated
passion.</p>

<p>The world has suffered no greater literary loss than the loss of
Sappho's poems. So perfect are the smallest fragments preserved
in Bergk's <i>Collection</i>&mdash;the line, for example (p. 890), &#7974;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;
&#7984;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#966;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#8053;&#948;&#969;&#957;,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> which Ben Jonson fancifully translated,
"the dear glad angel of the spring, the nightingale"&mdash;that we
muse in a sad rapture of astonishment to think what the complete
poems must have been. Among the ancients Sappho enjoyed
a unique renown. She was called "The Poetess," as
Homer was called "The Poet." Aristotle quoted without question
a judgment that placed her in the same rank as Homer and
Archilochus. Plato in the <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i> mentioned her as the tenth
muse. Solon, hearing one of her poems, prayed that he might
not see death till he had learned it. Strabo speaks of her genius
with religious awe. Longinus cites her love-ode as a specimen of
poetical sublimity. The epigrammatists call her Child of Aphrodite
and Eros, nursling of the Graces and Persuasion, pride of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>Hellas, peer of Muses, companion of Apollo. Nowhere is a hint
whispered that her poetry was aught but perfect. As far as we
can judge, these praises were strictly just. Of all the poets of
the world, of all the illustrious artists of all literatures, Sappho is
the one whose every word has a peculiar and unmistakable perfume,
a seal of absolute perfection and inimitable grace. In her
art she was unerring. Even Archilochus seems commonplace
when compared with her exquisite rarity of phrase.</p>

<p>About her life&mdash;her brother Charaxus, her daughter Cleis, her
rejection of Alc&aelig;us and her suit to Phaon, her love for Atthis
and Anactoria, her leap from the Leucadian cliff&mdash;we know so
very little, and that little is so confused with mythology and turbid
with the scandal of the comic poets, that it is not worth while
to rake up once again the old materials for hypothetical conclusions.
There is enough of heart-devouring passion in Sappho's
own verse without the legends of Phaon and the cliff of Leucas.
The reality casts all fiction into the shade; for nowhere, except,
perhaps, in some Persian or Proven&ccedil;al love-songs, can be found
more ardent expressions of overmastering emotion. Whether
addressing the maidens, whom even in Elysium, as Horace says,
Sappho could not forget; or embodying the profounder yearnings
of an intense soul after beauty, which has never on earth
existed, but which inflames the hearts of noblest poets, robbing
their eyes of sleep and giving them the bitterness of tears to
drink&mdash;these dazzling fragments,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Which still, like sparkles of Greek fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burn on through time and ne'er expire,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are the ultimate and finished forms of passionate utterance, diamonds,
topazes, and blazing rubies, in which the fire of the soul
is crystallized forever. Adequately to translate Sappho was beyond
the power of even Catullus: that love-ode which Longinus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
called "not one passion, but a congress of passions," and which a
Greek physician copied into his book of diagnoses as a compendium
of all the symptoms of corroding emotion, appears but languid
in its Latin dress of "Ille mi par." Far less has any modern
poet succeeded in the task: Rossetti, who deals so skilfully
with Dante and Villon, is comparatively tame when he approaches
Sappho. Instead of attempting, therefore, to interpret for
English readers the charm of Sappho's style,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> it is best to refer
to pp. 874-924 of Bergk, where every vestige that is left of her
is shrined.</p>

<p>Beside Sappho, Alc&aelig;us pales. His drinking-songs and war-songs
have, indeed, great beauty; but they are not to be named
in the same breath, for perfection of style, with the stanzas of
Sappho. Of his life we know a few not wholly uninteresting incidents.
He was a noble of Mitylene, the capital of Lesbos, where
he flourished as early as 611 B.C. Alc&aelig;us belonged to a family
of distinguished men. His brothers Cicis and Antimenidas upheld
the party of the oligarchy against the tyrant Melanchrus;
and during the troubles which agitated Mitylene after the fall of
this despot, while other petty tyrants&mdash;Myrsilus, Megalagyrus,
and the Cleanactids&mdash;were attempting to subdue the island, the
three brothers ranged themselves uniformly on the side of the
aristocracy. At first they seem to have been friendly with Pittacus.
It was while fighting at his side against the Athenians at
Sigeum that Alc&aelig;us threw his shield away&mdash;- an exploit which,
like Archilochus, he celebrated in a poem without apparently
damaging his reputation for valor. Being a stout soldier, a violent
partisan, the bard of revolutions, and the brother of a pair of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>heroes, he could trifle with this little accident, which less doughty
warriors must have concealed. When Pittacus was chosen &AElig;symnetes,
or dictator with despotic power for the preservation of
public order, in 589 B.C., Alc&aelig;us and his brothers went into opposition
and were exiled. All three of them were what in modern
politics we should call High Tories. They could not endure
the least approach to popular government, the slightest infringement
of the rights of the nobility. During his exile Alc&aelig;us employed
his poetic faculty in vituperating Pittacus. His satires
were esteemed almost as pungent as those of Archilochus. But
the liberal-minded ruler did not resent them. When Alc&aelig;us was
on one occasion taken prisoner, he set him free, remarking that
"forgiveness is better than revenge." Alc&aelig;us lived to be reconciled
with him and to recognize his merits. As a trait in the
domestic life and fortunes of the Greeks of this time, it is worth
mentioning that Alc&aelig;us took refuge in Egypt during his banishment
from Lesbos, and that his brother Antimenidas entered the
service of the king of Babylon. In the same way two Englishmen
in the times of the Edwards might have travelled in Germany
or become soldiers of the Republic of Florence. Of the
Greek oligarch who lent his sword to Nebuchadnezzar&mdash;in his
wars, perhaps, against Jehoiakim or Pharaoh-Necho&mdash;we get
a curious glimpse. Alc&aelig;us greeted him on his return in a
poem of which we possess a fragment, and which may be paraphrased
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the ends of the earth thou art come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to thy home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ivory hilt of thy blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gold is embossed and inlaid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since for Babylon's host a great deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou didst work in their need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slaying a warrior, an athlete of might,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Royal, whose height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lacked of five cubits one span&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A terrible man.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We can fancy with what delight and curiosity Alc&aelig;us, who,
as may be gathered from his poems, was an amateur of armor,
examined this sword-handle, wrought perhaps from Ethiopian
tusks by Egyptian artists, with lotos-flowers or patterns of crocodiles,
monkeys, and lions. This story of the polished Greek citizen's
adventure among the Jews and Egyptians, known to us
through Holy Writ, touches our imagination with the same
strange sense of novelty as when we read of the Persian poet
S&acirc;dy, a slave in the camp of Richard C&#339;ur de Lion's Crusaders.</p>

<p>Considering the life Alc&aelig;us led, it is not strange that he
should have sung of arms and civic struggles. Many fragments,
preserved in all probability from the <i>Stasiotica</i>, or Songs of Sedition,
which were very popular among the ancients, throw light
upon the stormier passages of his history. One of these pieces<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
describes the poet's armory&mdash;his polished helmets and white
horse-hair plumes, the burnished brazen greaves that hang upon
the wall, the linen breastplates and bucklers thrown in heaps
about the floor, with Chalkidian blades and girdles and tunics.
The most striking point about this fragment is its foppery. Alc&aelig;us
spares no pains to make us know how bright his armor is,
how carefully his greaves are fixed against the wall by pegs you
cannot see (&#960;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#8049;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#961;&#8059;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;&#953;), how carelessly the
girdles and small gear are tossed about in sumptuous disarray.
The poem seems to reveal a luxurious nature delighting in military
millinery. No Dorian would have described his weapons
from this point of view, but would have rather told us how
often they had been used with effect in the field. The &AElig;olian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>character is here tempered with Orientalism.</p>

<p>Of the erotic poems of Alc&aelig;us, only a very few and inconsiderable
fragments have survived. Horace says of them, addressing
his lyre:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lesbio primum modulate civi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui ferox bello, tamen inter arma,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sive jactatam relig&acirc;rat udo<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Littore navim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Liberum et Musas Veneremque et illi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Semper h&aelig;rentem puerum canebat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et Lycum nigris oculis nigroque<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Crine decorum.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of Lycus we only know, on the authority of Cicero,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that he
had a wart upon the finger, which Alc&aelig;us praised in one of his
poems. It has also been conjectured that the line &#959;&#7990;&#957;&#959;&#962;, &#8038; &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#949;
&#960;&#945;&#8055;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#955;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#945;&mdash;"wine, dear boy, and truth"&mdash;which Theocritus
quotes as a proverb at the beginning of his &AElig;olic Idyl, was
addressed to Lycus. A fragment of far greater interest is the
couplet preserved by Heph&aelig;stion,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> in which Alc&aelig;us calls on
Sappho by her name: "Violet-crowned, pure, sweet-smiling
Sappho! I want to say something, but shame prevents me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>To this declaration Sappho replied: "If thy wishes were fair and
noble, and thy tongue designed not to utter what is base, shame
would not cloud thine eyes, but thou wouldst speak thy just desires."
This is all we know about the love-passages between the
greatest lyrists of the &AElig;olian school. In this way do the ancient
critics tantalize us. Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> in order to illustrate a moral
proposition, Heph&aelig;stion, with a view to proving a metrical rule,
fling these scraps of their wealth forth, little dreaming that after
twenty centuries the men of new nations and other thoughts will
eagerly collect the scraps, and long for more of that which might
have been so freely lavished. Whether Sappho wrote her reply
in maidenly modesty because the advances of Alc&aelig;us were really
dishonorable, or whether she affected indignation to conceal a
personal dislike for the poet, we cannot say. Aristotle or Heph&aelig;stion
might, probably, have been able to tell us. But the
one was only thinking of the signs of shame, while the attention
of the other was riveted upon the "so-called <i>dodecasyllable
Alcaic</i>."</p>

<p>The most considerable remains of the lyrics of Alc&aelig;us are
drinking-songs&mdash;praises of wine, combined with reflections upon
life and appropriate descriptions of the different seasons. No
time was amiss for drinking, to his mind: the heat of summer,
the cold of winter, the blazing dog-star and the driving tempest,
twilight with its cheerful gleam of lamps, mid-day with its sunshine&mdash;all
suggest reasons for indulging in the cup. Not that
we are justified in fancying Alc&aelig;us to have been a vulgar toper:
he retained &AElig;olian sumptuousness in his pleasures, and raised the
art of drinking to an &aelig;sthetic altitude. One well-known piece
from the <i>Par&#339;nia</i> of Alc&aelig;us is capable of translation into Elizabethan
rhymed verse as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rain of Zeus descends, and from high heaven<br /></span>

<p>The debt of Horace to Alc&aelig;us must have been immense. The
fragment just translated is the original of the ninth ode of the
first book. The fragment on the death of Myrsilus, &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#967;&#961;&#8052; &#956;&#949;&#952;&#8059;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#957;,
shows where Horace found the model for the last ode of
the first book. Again, "O navis referent" (Hor., <i>Carm.</i>, i. 14) is
based on an ode of the Lesbian poet of which we possess a fragment.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Between the temperaments of Horace and of Alc&aelig;us, as
between those of Catullus and of Sappho, there were marked similarities
and correspondences. The poetry of both Horace and
Alc&aelig;us was polished rather than profound, admirably sketched
rather than richly colored, more graceful than intense, less passionate
than reflective. In Sappho and Catullus, on the other
hand, we meet with richer and more ardent natures: they are
endowed with keener sensibilities, with a sensuality more noble
because of its intensity, with emotions more profound, with a
deeper faculty of thought, that never loses itself in the shallows
of "Stoic-Epicurean acceptance," but simply and exquisitely apprehends
the facts of human life. Where Horace talks of Orcus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>and the Urn, Catullus sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soles occidere et redire possunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nobis cum semel occidit brevis lux<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nox est perpetua una dormienda.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This contrast between the polished sententiousness of Horace and
the pathetic outcry of Catullus marks the difference between two
classes of poets to whom Horace and Alc&aelig;us, Sappho and Catullus,
respectively belong.</p>

<p>Of the other Lesbian poets, Erinna and Damophila, we know
but little: the one survives in a single epigram&mdash;if we reject the
epitaphs on Baucis; the other is a mere name. It is noticeable
that of the four Lesbian poets three are women. We may remember
that in Thebes, which was also an &AElig;olian city, Myrtis
and Corinna rivalled Pindar.</p>

<p>To the list of &AElig;olian poets, Anacreon, though an Ionian by
birth and an Ionian in temperament, is generally added, because
he cultivated the lyrical stanza of personal emotion. Into the
&AElig;olian style Anacreon introduced a new and uncongenial element.
His passion had none of Sappho's fiery splendor, none of
the haughtiness and restlessness which distinguished Alc&aelig;us.
There was a vein of levity, almost of vulgarity, in the Ionians,
which removed them from the altitudes of Dorian heroism and
&AElig;olian enthusiasm. This tincture of flippancy is discernible in
Anacreon. Life and love come easily to him. The roses keep
no secrets for his ears, such as they told to Sappho: they serve
very well for garlands when he drinks, and have a pleasant smell,
especially in myrrh. The wine-cup does not suggest to him variety
of seasons&mdash;the frozen streams of winter, the parched breath
of the dog-star&mdash;as with Alc&aelig;us: he tipples and gets drunk.
His loves, too, are facile&mdash;neither permanent nor tempestuous.
The girls and boys of whom he sings were flute-players and cupbearers,
servants of a tyrant, <i>instrumenta libidinis</i>, chosen for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
their looks, as the poet had been selected for the sweetness of his
lyre with twenty chords. He never felt the furnace of Sappho,
whose love, however criminal in the estimation of modern moralists,
was serious and of the soul. The difference between the
lives of these three lyrists is very striking. Alc&aelig;us was a politician
and party leader. Sappho was the centre of a free society
of female poets. Anacreon was the courtier and laureate of tyrants.
He won his first fame with Polycrates, at whose death
Hipparchus fetched him to Athens in a trireme of fifty oars. Between
Bacchus and Venus he spent his days in palaces; and died
at the ripe age of eighty-five at Teos, choked, it is reported, by a
grape-stone&mdash;a hoary-headed <i>rou&eacute;</i>, for whom the rhyme of the
medi&aelig;val Arcipoeta might have been written:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meum est propositum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In taberna mori, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It need not be remarked that of the genuine poems of Anacreon
we possess but few (pp. 1011-1045 of Bergk). His great popularity
in Greece led to innumerable imitations of his lighter style.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
These are fully preserved in Bergk's <i>Collection</i> (pp. 1046-1108).</p>

<p>The Dorian style offers a marked contrast to the &AElig;olian. In
the case of the Ionian satirists and elegists, and in that of the
&AElig;olian lyrists, the national peculiarities of the art resulted from
national qualities in the artists. This is not the case with the so-called
Dorian poets. The great lyrists of this school are, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>one exception, of extraction foreign to the Dorian tribe. Alcman
was a Lydian; Stesichorus acknowledged an Ionian colony for
his fatherland; Arion was a Lesbian; Simonides and Bacchylides
were Ionian; Pindar was B&#339;otian; Ibycus of Rhegium alone was
a Dorian. Why, then, is the style called Dorian? Because the
poets, though not Dorian by birth, wrote for Dorian patrons in
the land of Dorians, to add splendor to ceremonies and solemnities
in vogue among the Dorians. The distinctive features of
this, the most sublime branch of Greek lyrical poetry, have been
already hinted at: these elaborate choral hymns, in which strophe
answers to antistrophe, and epode to epode, chanted by bands of
singers and accompanied at times by dancing, were designed to
give expression, no longer to personal emotions, but to the feelings
of great congregations of men engaged in the celebration of
gods and heroes and illustrious mortals. Why this species of
choral poetry received the patronage and name of the Dorian tribe
may be seen by glancing at the institutions peculiar to this section
of the Hellenic family. The Dorians, more than any other
Greeks, lived in common and in public. Their children were educated,
not at home, but in companies, beneath the supervision
of state-officers. Girls as well as boys submitted to gymnastic
training, and were taught to sacrifice domestic and personal to
political and social interests. Tutored to merge the individual in
the mass, habituated to associate together in large bodies, the Dorians
felt no need of venting private feeling. Their personal
emotions were stunted: they had no separate wants and wishes,
aspirations and regrets, to utter. Yet the sense of melody and
harmony which was rooted so profoundly in the Greek temperament
needed some outlet even here; while the gymnastic and
athletic exercises practised by the Dorians rendered them peculiarly
sensitive, not only to the beauties of the human body,
but also to the refinements of rhythmical movement. Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>e spiritual
enthusiasm for great and glorious actions, which formed the
soul of the Greek race, flamed with all the greater brilliancy among
Dorians, because it was not narrowed, as among the &AElig;olians, to
the selfish passions of the individual, or diverted, as among Ionians,
to meditation or satire; but was concentrated on public interests,
on religious and heroic traditions, on all the thoughts and
feelings which stimulate a large political activity. The Dorians
required a poetry which should be public, which should admit of
the participation of many individuals, which should give utterance
to national enthusiasms, which should combine the movements
of men and women in choric evolutions with the melodies
of music and the sublime words of inspired prophecy. In brief,
the Dorians needed poets able&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"to inbreed and cherish in a great people the seeds of virtue and public
civility, to allay the perturbations of the mind, and set the affections in right
tune; to celebrate in glorious and lofty hymns the throne and equipage of
God's Almightiness, and what he works, and what he suffers to be wrought
with high Providence.... Lastly, whatsoever in religion is holy and sublime,
in virtue amiable or grave; whatsoever hath passion or admiration in all the
changes of that which is called fortune from without, or the wily subtleties
and reflexes of man's thoughts from within; all these things, with a solid
and treatable smoothness, to paint out and describe."</p></div>

<p>But here arose a difficulty. With all their need of the highest
and most elaborate poetry, with all their sensibility to beauty, the
Dorians thought it beneath the dignity of a citizen to practise
the arts. Their education, almost exclusively military and gymnastic,
unfitted them, at all events in Sparta, for studies indispensable
towards gaining proficiency in any science so elaborate as
that of choral poetry. Drilled to abstinence, obedience, and silence,
dwelling in a camp, without privacy or leisure, how could a
Spartan, that automaton of the State, be expected to produce
poetry, or excel in any fine art? A Spartan king, on being s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>hown
the most distinguished musician of his age, pointed to his cook
as the best maker of black broth. Music, if music they must
have; poetry, if poetry were required by some divinely implanted
instinct; dancing, if dancing were a necessary compliment to the
Deity, must be imported by these warriors from foreign lands.
Thus the Spartans became the patrons of stranger artists, on
whom they imposed their laws of taste. They pressed the flexible
Ionian, the passionate Lesbian, the languid Lydian, the acute
Athenian, into their service, and made them use the crabbed Dorian
speech. They said: We want such and such odes for our
choruses; we wish to amuse our youths and maidens, and to honor
the gods with pompous harmonies; you, men of art, write for
us, sing for us; but be careful to comprehend our character; and
remember that, though you are Ionians or Lesbians, your inspiration
must be Dorian. They got what they required. The so-called
Dorian lyric is a genuine product of the Dorian race, although
its greatest masters were foreigners and aliens. Much
after the same fashion did England patronize Handel in the last
century; in the same way may Handel's oratorios be called English
music; for though the English are not musicians, and are
diffident in general of the artist class, yet neither Germans nor
Italians nor French have seen produced upon their soil such colossal
works of art in the service of a highly intellectual religion.</p>

<p>It is interesting to reflect upon the influence of the Dorian race
in the evolution of Greek art. That, as a nation, they possessed
the germs of artistic invention, and that their character expressed
itself very clearly in &aelig;sthetic forms, is evident from the existence
of the Dorian style in architecture, and the Dorian mood in music,
both of which reflect their broad simplicity and strength disdaining
ornament. The same stamp they impressed upon Greek
poetry, through the instruments they selected from other tribes.
Had it not been for the strict legislation of Lycurgus, which, b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>y
forcing Sparta into a purely political development, and establishing
a complete community of life among the citizens, checked the
emergence of that individuality which is so all-important to the
artist, Sparta might have counted her great sculptors, poets, musicians,
orators, and painters, in rivalry with Pheidias, Sophocles,
Damon, Pericles, Polygnotus. As it was, though without hands
to paint and carve, without lips to sing and plead, the stubborn
Dorian race set its seal on a wide field of Greek art.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The elaborate works of the choral lyrists may be regarded as
the highly wrought expansions of rudiments already existing
among the Dorians. Alcman, Arion, and Stesichorus, the three
masters who formed choral poetry from the materials indicated
to us in the poems of Homer, and who had to blend in one harmonious
whole the sister arts of dancing, music, and poetry, so as
to present a pompous appeal to the intellect through speech, and
through the ear and eye, found ready to their hands such simple
songs as may be read in Bergk, pp. 1297-1303. The dithyramb
of the women of Elis: "Come, hero, Dionysus, to the holy sea-temple,
attended by the Graces, and rushing on with oxen-hoof!
Holy ox! Holy ox!" The chorus of the old men, men, and boys
at Sparta: "We once were stalwart youths: we are; if thou
likest, try our strength: we shall be; and far better too!" The
march-song of the Spartans in their rhythmic revels: "Advance,
boys, set your feet forward, and dance in the reel better still."
From these had to be trained the complex and magnificent work
of art, which culminated in a Pythian ode of Pindar! Alcman
was a native of Sardis, and a slave of Agesilaus the Spartan. He
flourished at Sparta between 671 and 631 B.C., composing Parthenia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>for the maidens of Taygetus. Who does not know his
lines upon the valley of Eurotas? "Sleep holds the mountain
summits and ravines, the promontories and the watercourses;
leaves, and creeping things, and whatsoever black earth breeds;
and wild beasts of the hills, and bees, and monsters in the hollows
of the dark blue deep; and all the wide-winged birds are
sleeping." Junior to Alcman was Arion, who spent most of his
time with Periander at Corinth. His contribution to choral poetry
was the elaboration of the dithyramb. But of his work we
have unfortunately not a single fragment left. The piece that
bears his name (Bergk, p. 872) has to be ascribed to some tolerable
poet of the Euripidean period. His life is involved in mythology;
most beautiful is the oft-told tale of his salvation from
the sea waves by an enamoured dolphin&mdash;a fish, by the way, which
Athen&aelig;us dignified by the title of &#966;&#953;&#955;&#8183;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#945;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#962; (song-loving
and flute-loving), and which Aristotle calls &#966;&#953;&#955;&#8049;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;
(affectionate to men). Rather more is known about Stesichorus.
He was a native of Himera in Sicily, but possibly a Locrian by
descent. His parents called him Tisias, but he took his more famous
name from his profession. Stesichorus is a title that might
have been given to any chorus-master in a Greek city; but Tisias
of Himera won it by being emphatically the author of the choric
system. Antiquity recognized in him the inventor of strophe,
antistrophe, and epode, with the corresponding movements of
the dance, which were designated the Triad of Stesichorus. A
remark made by Quintilian about this poet&mdash;that he sustained
the burden of the epos with his lyre&mdash;forms a valuable criticism
on his style. In the days of Stesichorus, the epic proper had lost
its vitality; but people still felt the liveliest interest in heroic legends,
and loved to connect the celebration of the past with their
ceremonies. A lyrical poet had therefore so to treat the myths
of Hellas that choruses should represent them in their odes an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>d
semi-dramatic dances. It is probable that Stesichorus made far
more use of mythical material than Pindar, dealing with it less
allusively and adhering more closely to the epic form of narrative.
When we hear of his ode, the Orestea, being divided into
three books (whatever that may mean), and read the titles of the
rest&mdash;Cerberus, Cycnus, Scylla, Europa, the Sack of Troy, the
Nostoi, and Geryonis&mdash;we are led to suspect that his choral compositions
were something of the nature of medi&aelig;val mystery-plays&mdash;semi-lyrical,
semi-dramatic poems, founded on the religious
legends of the past. Stesichorus did not confine himself to
this species of composition, but wrote hymns, encomia, and p&aelig;ans,
like other professional lyrists who succeeded him, and invented a
curious kind of love-tale from real life. One of these romantic
poems, called Calyc&eacute;, was about a girl who loved purely but unhappily,
and died. Another, called Rhadina, told the forlorn tale
of a Samian brother and sister put to death by a cruel tyrant.
It is a pity that these early Greek novels in verse are lost. We
might have found in them the fresh originals of Daphnis and
Chloe, or of the romances of Tatius and Heliodorus. Finally,
Stesichorus composed fables, such as the Horse and the Stag, and
pastorals upon the death of Daphnis, in which he proved himself
true to his Sicilian origin, and anticipated Theocritus. Enough
has been said about Stesichorus to show that he was a richly inventive
genius&mdash;one of those facile and abundant natures who
excel in many branches of art, and who give hints by which posterity
may profit. Yet with all his genius he was not thoroughly
successful. His pastorals and romances were abandoned by
his successors; his epical lyrics were lost in the tragic drama.
Like many other poets, he failed by coming at a wrong moment,
or else by adhering to forms of art which could not long remain
in vogue. In his attempt to reconcile the epical treatment of
mythology with the choric system of his own invention, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
proved that he had not fully grasped the capabilities of lyrical
poetry. In his endeavor to create an idyllic and romantic species,
he was far before his age.</p>

<p>The remaining choral poets of the Dorian style, of whom the
eldest, Ibycus, dates half a century later than Arion, received from
their predecessors an instrument of poetical expression already
nearly complete. It was their part to use it as skilfully as possible,
and to introduce such changes as might render it more polished.
Excellence of workmanship is particularly noticeable in
what remains of Ibycus, Simonides, Bacchylides. These latter
lyrists are no longer local poets: under the altered circumstances
of Hellas at the time of the Persian war, art has become Panhellenic,
the artists cease to be the servants of one state or of one
deity; they range from city to city, giving their services to all
who seek for them, and embracing the various tribes and religious
rites of the collected Greeks in their &aelig;sthetic sympathy. Now,
for the first time, poets began to sell their songs of praise for
money. Simonides introduced the practice, which had something
shocking in it to Greek taste, and which Plato especially censures
as sophistic and illiberal in his <i>Protagoras</i>. Now, too, poets became
the friends and counsellors of princes, mixing freely in the
politics of Samos, Syracuse, Agrigentum, Thessaly; aiding the
tyrants Polycrates, Hiero, Theron, the Scopads, with their advice.
Simonides is said to have suspended hostilities between Theron
and Hiero by his diplomatic intercession after their armies had
been drawn up in battle-array. Petrarch did not occupy a more
important place among the princes and republics of medi&aelig;val
Italy. Under these new conditions, and with this expansion of
the poet's calling, the old character of the Dorian lyric changed.
The title Dorian is now merely nominal, and the dialect is a conventional
language consecrated to this style.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>
<p>Ibycus was a native of Rhegium, a colony of mixed Ionians
and Dorians. To which of these families he belonged is not certain.
If we judged by the internal evidence of his poems, we
should call him an Ionian; for they are distinguished by voluptuous
sweetness, with a dash of almost &AElig;olian intensity. Ibycus
was a poet-errant, carrying his songs from state to state. The
beautiful story of the cranes who led to the discovery of his murder
at Corinth, though probably mythical, like that of Arion's
dolphin, illustrates the rude lives of these Greek troubadours,
and shows in what respect the <i>sacer vates</i>, servant of the Muses
and beloved of Ph&#339;bus, was held by the people. Ibycus was regarded
by antiquity as a kind of male Sappho. His odes, composed
for birthday festivals and banquets, were dedicated chiefly
to the praise of beautiful youths; and the legends which adorned
them, like those of Ganymede or Tithonus, were appropriate to
the erotic style. Aristophanes, in the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>, makes
Agathon connect him with Anacreon and Alc&aelig;us, as the three
refiners of language. It is clear, therefore, that in his art Ibycus
adapted the manner of Dorian poetry to the matter of &AElig;olian or
Ionian love-chants. Of his poetry we have but few fragments.
The following seems to strike the keynote of his style: "Love
once again looking upon me from his cloud-black brows, with
languishing glances, drives me by enchantments of all kinds to
the endless nets of Cypris: verily I tremble at his onset, as a
chariot-horse, who hath won prizes, in old age goes grudgingly to
try his speed in the swift race of cars." In another piece he
compares the onset of Love to a downrush of the Thracian north
wind armed with lightning. This fragment, numbered first in
Bergk's <i>Collection</i>, is taken from Athen&aelig;us, who quotes it to
prove the vehement emotion of the poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In spring Cydonian apple-trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watered by fountains ever flowing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through crofts unmown of maiden goddesses,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And young vines, 'neath the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shooting tendrils, tranquilly are growing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile for me Love never laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In slumber, like a north-wind glowing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Thracian lightnings, still doth dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood-parching madness on my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Kupris hurtling, stormful, wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lording the man as erst the child.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is interesting to compare the different metaphors whereby
the early lyrists imaged the assaults of the Love-god. Sappho
describes him in one place as a youth arrayed with a flame-colored
chlamys descending from heaven; in another she calls him
"a limb-dissolving, bitter-sweet, impracticable wild beast;" again,
she compares the state of her soul under the influence of love to
oak-trees torn and shaken by a mountain whirlwind. Anacreon
paints a fine picture of Love like a blacksmith, forging his soul
and tempering it in icy torrents. The dubious winged figure
armed with a heavy sword, which is carved upon the recently
discovered column from the Temple of Ephesus, if he be the
Love-god, and not, as some conjecture, Death, seems to have been
conceived in the spirit of these energetic metaphors. The Greeks,
at the period of Anacreon and Ibycus, were far from having as
yet imagined the baby Cupid of Moschus, the Epigrammatists,
and the Alexandrian Anacreontics. He was still a terrible and
passion-stirring power&mdash;no mere malicious urchin coming by
night with drenched wings and unstrung bow to reward the poet's
hospitality by wounding him; no naughty boy who runs away
from his mother and steals honeycombs, no bee-like elf asleep in
rosebuds.</p>

<p>Simonides is a far more brilliant representative than Ibycus,
both of Greek choral poetry in its prime, and also of the whole
literary life of Hellas during the period which immediately preceded
and followed the Persian war. He was born in the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
of Ceos, of pure Ionian blood and breeding; but the Ionians of
Ceos were celebrated for their &#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951; (reserve, or self-restraint),
a quality strongly marked in the poems of Simonides.
In his odes we do not trace that mixture of &AElig;olian passion and
that concentration upon personal emotions which are noticeable
in those of Ibycus, but rather a Dorian solemnity of thought and
feeling, qualifying Simonides for the arduous functions to which
he was called, of commemorating in elegy and epigram and funeral
ode the achievements of Hellas against Persia. Simonides
belonged to a family of professional poets; for the arts among
the early Greeks were hereditary; a father taught the trade of
flute-playing and chorus-leading and verse-making to his son, who,
if he had original genius, became a great poet, as was the fate of
Pindar; or, if he were endowed with commonplace abilities, remained
a journeyman in art without discredit to himself, performing
useful functions in his native place.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Simonides exercised
his calling of chorus-teacher at Carth&aelig;a in Ceos, and lived at the
&#967;&#959;&#961;&#951;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;, or resort of the chorus, near the temple of Apollo.
But the greater portion of his life, after he had attained celebrity,
was passed with patrons&mdash;with Hipparchus, who invited him to
Athens, where he dwelt at amity with Anacreon, and at enmity
with Pindar's master, Lasos; with the Scopads and Aleuads of
Thessaly, for whom he composed the most touching threnoi and
the most brilliant panegyrics, of which fragments have descended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>to us; finally, with Hiero of Syracuse, who honored him exceedingly,
and when he died consigned him to the earth with princely
funeral pomp. The relations of Simonides to these patrons may
be gathered from numerous slight indications, none of which are
very honorable to his character. For instance, after receiving the
hospitality of Hipparchus, he composed an epigram for the statue
of Harmodius, in which he calls the murder of the tyrant "a great
light rising upon Athens." Again, he praised the brutal Scopas,
son of Creon, in an ode which is celebrated, both as being connected
with the most dramatic incident in the poet's life, and also
as having furnished Plato with a theme for argument, and Aristotle
with an ethical quotation&mdash;"To be a good man in very
truth, a square without blame, is hard." This proposition Plato
discusses in the <i>Protagoras</i>, while Aristotle cites the phrase, &#964;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#8049;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;
&#7940;&#957;&#949;&#965; &#968;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#965; (four-square without fault). From the general
tenor of the fragments of this ode, from Plato's criticism, and
from what is known about the coarse nature of Scopas, who is
being praised, we must conjecture that Simonides attempted to
whitewash his patron's character by depreciating the standard of
morality. With Ionian facility and courtly compliment, he made
excuses for a bad man by pleading that perfect goodness was unattainable.
Scopas refused to pay the price required by Simonides
for the poem in question, telling him to get half of it from
the Dioscuri, who had also been eulogized. This was at a banquet.
While the king was laughing at his own rude jest, a servant
whispered to the poet that two goodly youths waited without,
desiring earnestly to speak with him. Simonides left the palace,
but found no one. Even as he stood looking for his visitors, he
heard the crash of beams and the groans of dying men. Scopas
with his guests had been destroyed by the falling of the roof, and
Simonides had received a godlike guerdon from the two sons of
Tyndareus. This story belongs, perhaps, to the same class as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>the
cranes of Ibycus and the dolphin of Arion. Yet there seems to
be no doubt that the Scopad dynasty was suddenly extinguished;
for we hear nothing of them at the time of the Persian war, and
we know that Simonides composed a threnos for the family.</p>

<p>The most splendid period of the life of Simonides was that
which he passed at Athens during the great wars with Persia.
Here he was the friend of Miltiades, Themistocles, and Pausanias.
Here he composed his epigrams on Marathon, Thermopyl&aelig;, Salamis,
Plat&aelig;a&mdash;poems not destined to be merely sung or consigned
to parchment, but to be carved in marble or engraved in letters
of imperishable bronze upon the works of the noblest architects
and statuaries. The genius of Simonides is unique in this branch
of monumental poetry. His couplets&mdash;calm, simple, terse, strong
as the deeds they celebrate, enduring as the brass or stone which
they adorned&mdash;animated succeeding generations of Greek patriots;
they were transferred to the brains of statesmen like Pericles
and Demosthenes, inscribed upon the fleshy tablets of the hearts
of warriors like Cleomenes, Pelopidas, Epaminondas. We are
thrice fortunate in possessing the entire collection of these epigrams,
unrivalled for the magnitude of the events they celebrate,
and for the circumstances under which they were composed.
When we reflect what would have become of the civilization of
the world but for these Greek victories&mdash;when we remember that
the events which these few couplets record transcend in importance
those of any other single period of history&mdash;we are almost
appalled by the contrast between the brevity of the epigrams and
the world-wide vastness of their matter. In reviewing the life of
Simonides, after admitting that he was greedy of gain and not
adverse to flattery, we are bound to confess that, as a poet, he
proved himself adequate to the age of Marathon and Salamis.
He was the voice of Hellas&mdash;the genius of Fame, sculpturing
upon her brazen shield with a pen of adamant, in austere le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>tters
of indelible gold, the achievements to which the whole world
owes its civilization. Happy poet! Had ever any other man
so splendid a heritage of song allotted to him?</p>

<p>In style Simonides is always pure and exquisitely polished.
The ancients called him the sweet poet&mdash;Melicertes&mdash;<i>par excellence</i>.
His &#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;, or tempered self-restraint, gives a mellow
tone not merely to his philosophy and moral precepts, but also to
his art. He has none of Pindar's rugged majesty, volcanic force,
gorgeous exuberance: he does not, like Pindar, pour forth an inexhaustible
torrent of poetical ideas, chafing against each other in
the eddies of breathless inspiration. On the contrary, he works
up a few thoughts, a few carefully selected images, with patient
skill, producing a perfectly harmonious result, but one which is
always bordering on the commonplace. Like all correct poets, he
is somewhat tame, though tender, delicate, and exquisitely beautiful.
Pindar electrifies his hearer, seizing him like the eagle in
Dante's vision, and bearing him breathless through the ether of
celestial flame. Simonides leads us by the hand along the banks
of pleasant rivers, through laurel groves, and by the porticos of
sunny temples. What he possesses of quite peculiar to his own
genius is pathos&mdash;the pathos of romance. This appears most
remarkably in the fragment of a threnos which describes Dana&euml;
afloat upon the waves at night. It is with the greatest diffidence
that I offer a translation of what remains one of the most perfect
pieces of pathetic poetry in any literature:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When, in the carven chest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds that blew and waves in wild unrest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote her with fear, she, not with cheeks unwet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her arms of love round Perseus set,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And said: O child, what grief is mine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou dost slumber, and thy baby breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sunk in rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in the cheerless brass-bound bark,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Tossed amid starless night and pitchy dark.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor dost thou heed the scudding brine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waves that wash above thy curls so deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the shrill winds that sweep,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lapped in thy purple robe's embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair little face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if this dread were dreadful too to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then wouldst thou lend thy listening ear to me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore I cry,&mdash;Sleep, babe, and sea be still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slumber our unmeasured ill!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, may some change of fate, sire Zeus, from thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descend, our woes to end!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if this prayer, too overbold, offend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy justice, yet be merciful to me!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The careful development of simple thoughts in Simonides may
best be illustrated by the fragment on the three hundred Spartans
who died at Thermopyl&aelig;:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Of those who died at Thermopyl&aelig; glorious is the fate and fair the doom;
their grave is an altar; instead of lamentation, they have endless fame; their
dirge is a chant of praise. Such winding-sheet as theirs no rust, no, nor all-conquering
time, shall bring to naught. But this sepulchre of brave men hath
taken for its habitant the glory of Hellas. Leonidas is witness, Sparta's
king, who hath left a mighty crown of valor and undying fame."</p></div>

<p>The antitheses are wrought with consummate skill; the fate of
the heroes is glorious, their doom honorable. So far the eulogy
is commonplace; then the same thought receives a bolder turn:
their grave is an altar. We do not lament for them so much as
hold them in eternal memory; our very songs of sorrow become
p&aelig;ans of praise. What follows is a still further expansion of the
leading theme: rust and time cannot affect their fame; Hellas
confides her glory to their tomb. Then generalities are quitted;
and Leonidas, the protagonist of Thermopyl&aelig;, appears.</p>

<p>In his threnoi Simonides has generally recourse to the common
grounds of consolation, which the Ionian elegists repeat <i>a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>d nauseam</i>,
dwelling upon the shortness and uncertainty and ills of life,
and tending rather to depress the survivors on their own account
than to comfort them for the dead.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In one he says, "Short is
the strength of men, and vain are all their cares, and in their brief
life trouble follows upon trouble; and death, that no man shuns,
is hung above our heads&mdash;for him both good and bad share
equally." It is impossible, while reading this lachrymose lament,
to forget the fragment of that mighty threnos of Pindar's which
sounds like a trumpet-blast for immortality, and, trampling under
feet the glories of this world, reveals the gladness of the souls
who have attained Elysium:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">For them the night all through,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In that broad realm below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendor of the sun spreads endless light;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their city of the tombs with incense-trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And golden chalices<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of flowers, and fruitage fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Scenting the breezy air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is laden. There with horses and with play,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From altars where the blazing fire is dense<br /></span>
<span class="i6">With perfumed frankincense,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Burned unto gods in heaven,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With scented gales and sweet airs amorous.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same note of melancholy reflection upon transient human
life may be traced in the following fragment ascribed to Simonides.
He is apparently rebuking Cleobulus of Lindus in Rhodes
for an arrogant epigraph inscribed upon some stel&eacute;.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those who are wise in heart and mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Lindian Cleobulus, find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naught in thy shallow vaunt aright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with the streams that flow for aye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vernal flowers that bloom and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fiery sun, the moon's mild rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong sea's eddying water-ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matchest a marble pillar's might&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, all things that have being are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the high gods inferior far;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But carven stone may not withstand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even a mortal's ruthless hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore thy words no wisdom teach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than an idiot's idle speech.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What has been said about Simonides applies in a great measure
also to Bacchylides, who was his nephew, pupil, and faithful follower.
The personality of Bacchylides, as a man and a poet, is
absorbed in that of his uncle&mdash;the greater bard, the more distinguished
actor on the theatre of the world. While Simonides
played his part in public life, Bacchylides gave himself up to the
elegant pleasures of society; while Simonides celebrated in epigrams
the military glories of the Greeks, Bacchylides wrote wine-songs
and congratulatory odes. His descriptions of Bacchic intoxication
and of the charms of peace display the same careful
word-painting as the description by Simonides of Orpheus, with
more luxuriance of sensual suggestion. His threnoi exhibit the
same Ionian despondency and resignation&mdash;a dead settled calm,
an elegant stolidity of epicureanism. That this excellent, if somewhat
languid, lyrist may receive his due meed of attention, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
selected his most important fragment, the <i>Praise of Peace</i>, for
translation (Bergk, vol. iii. p. 1230):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To mortal men Peace giveth these good things:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wealth, and the flowers of honey-throated song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flame that springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On carven altars from fat sheep and kine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slain to the gods in heaven; and, all day long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Games for glad youths, and flutes, and wreaths, and circling wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in the steely shield swart spiders weave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their web and dusky woof:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rust to the pointed spear and sword doth cleave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brazen trump sounds no alarms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is sleep harried from our eyes aloof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with sweet rest my bosom warms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streets are thronged with lovely men and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hymns in praise of boys like flames to heaven are flung.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tone common to Simonides and Bacchylides in funeral poems
will be illustrated by the four following fragments:<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Being a man, say not what comes to-morrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, seeing one in bliss, how long 'twill last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wide-winged fly was ne'er of flight so fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As change to sorrow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, not those elder men, who lived of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sceptred gods the half-immortal seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even they to prosperous old age wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A life from pain and death and danger freed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Short is the strength of men, and vain their trouble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through their brief age sorrows on sorrows double;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er each and all hangs death escaped by none;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him both good and bad an equal lot have won.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For mortal men not to be born is best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor e'er to see the bright beams of the day;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Since, as life rolls away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man that breathes was ever alway blest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here we must stop short in the front of Pindar&mdash;the Hamlet
among these lesser actors, the Shakespeare among a crowd of inferior
poets. To treat of Greek lyrical poetry and to omit Pindar
is a paradox in action. Yet Pindar is so colossal, so much
apart, that he deserves a separate study, and cannot be dragged
in at the end of a bird's-eye view of a period of literature. At
the time of Pindar, poetry was sinking into mannerism. He
by the force of his native originality gave it a wholly fresh direction,
and created a style as novel as it was inimitable. Like
some high mountain-peak, upon the border-land of plain and lesser
hills, he stands alone, sky-piercing and tremendous in his solitary
strength.</p>

<p>Before, however, entering upon the criticism of Pindar's poetry,
it will be of service to complete this review of the Greek lyric
by some specimens of those later artificial literary odes, a few of
which have been preserved for us by the anthologists and grammarians.
The following Hymn to Virtue has a special interest,
since it is ascribed to Aristotle, the philosopher, and makes allusion
to his friend, the tyrant of Atarneus. The comparative dryness
of the style is no less characteristic of the age in which the
poem is supposed to have been written, than its animating motive,
the beauty of Virtue, is true to the Greek conception of morality
and heroism.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Virtue, to men thou bringest care and toil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet art thou life's best, fairest spoil!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O virgin goddess, for thy beauty's sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die is delicate in this our Greece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to endure of pain the stern strong ache.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Such fruit for our soul's ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joys undying, dearer far than gold<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or home or soft-eyed sleep, dost thou unfold!<br /></span>
<span class="i10">It was for thee the seed of Zeus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stout Herakles, and Leda's twins, did choose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strength-draining deeds, to spread abroad thy name:<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Smit with the love of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Aias and Achileus went smilingly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to Death's portal, crowned with deathless fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Now, since thou art so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Leaving the lightsome air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atarneus' hero hath died gloriously.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore immortal praise shall be his guerdon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His goodness and his deeds are made the burden<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Of songs divine<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Sung by Memory's daughters nine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hymning of hospitable Zeus the might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And friendship firm as fate in fate's despite.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next is a Hymn to Health, hardly less true to Greek feeling
than the Hymn to Virtue. Simonides, it will be remembered,
had said that the first and best possession to be desired by man is
health. The ode is but a rhetorical expansion of this sentence,
showing that none of the good things of human life can be enjoyed
without physical well-being.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Health! Eldest, most august of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blessed gods, on thee I call!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, let me spend with thee the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mortal life, securely blest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, mayst thou be my house-mate still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shield and shelter me from ill!<br /></span>
<span class="i12">If wealth have any grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">If fair our children's face;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If kinghood, lifting men to be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Peers with the high gods' empery;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">If young Love's flying feet<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Through secret snares be sweet;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
<span class="i0">If aught of all heaven's gifts to mortals sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If rest from care be dear, or calm content&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These goodly things, each, all of them, with thee<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Bloom everlastingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blest Health! Yea, Beauty's year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks into spring for thee, for only thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without thee no man's life is aught but cold and drear.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As an example of the p&aelig;an or the prosodial hymn, when it assumed
a literary form, I may select an ode to Ph&#339;bus, which
bears the name of Dionysius. Apollo is here addressed in his
character of Light-giver, and leader of the lesser powers of heaven.
The stars and the moon are his attendants, rejoicing in his
music, and deriving from his might their glory.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Let all wide heaven be still!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Be silent vale and hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Earth and whispering wind and sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Voice of birds and echo shrill!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For soon amid our choir will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ph&#339;bus with floating locks, the Lord of Minstrelsy!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O father of the snow-browed morn;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thou who dost drive the rosy car<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of day's wing-footed coursers, borne<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With gleaming curls of gold unshorn<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Over heaven's boundless vault afar;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Weaving the woof of myriad rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wealth-scattering beams that burn and blaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Enwinding them round earth in endless maze!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The rivers of thy fire undying<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Beget bright day, our heart's desire:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The throng of stars to greet thee flying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through cloudless heaven, join choric dances,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hailing thee king with ceaseless crying<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For joy of thy Ph&#339;bean lyre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In front the gray-eyed Moon advances<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drawn by her snow-white heifers o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Night's silent silvery dancing-floor:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With gladness her mild bosom burns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As round the d&aelig;dal world she turns.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From these specimens we may infer the character of that semi-ethical,
semi-religious lyric poetry which was produced so copiously
in Greece, and of which we have lost all but accidental remnants.
Though not to be compared for grandeur of style and
abundance of grace with the odes of Pindar and the fragments
of Simonides, they display a careful workmanship, a clear and
harmonious development of ideas, that make us long, alas too
vainly, for the treasures of a literature now buried in irrevocable
oblivion.</p>

<i>PINDAR.</i></h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>His Life.&mdash;Legends connected with him.&mdash;The Qualities of his Poetry.&mdash;The
Olympic Games.&mdash;Pindar's Professional Character.&mdash;His Morality.&mdash;His
Religious Belief.&mdash;Doctrine of a Future State.&mdash;Rewards and Punishments.&mdash;The
Structure of his Odes.&mdash;The Proemia to his Odes.&mdash;His Difficulty
and Tumidity of Style.</p></div>


<p>Pindar, in spite of his great popularity among the Greeks, offers
no exception to the rule that we know but little of the lives
of the illustrious poets and artists of the world. His parents belonged
to the town of Cynoscephal&aelig;; but Pindar himself resided
at Thebes, and spoke of Thebes as his native place&mdash;&#920;&#8053;&#946;&#945; &#956;&#8118;&#964;&#949;&#961;
&#7952;&#956;&#8049;. That his father was called Daiphantus appears tolerably
certain; and we may fix the date of his birth at about 522 B.C.
He lived to the age of seventy-nine; so that the flourishing period
of his life exactly coincides with the great Persian struggle, in
which he lived to see Hellas victorious. He had three children&mdash;a
son, Daiphantus, and two daughters, Eumetis and Protomache.
His family was among the noblest and most illustrious of Thebes,
forming a branch of the ancient house of the &AElig;geid&aelig;, who settled
both at Thebes and Sparta in heroic times, and offshoots
from whom were colonists of Thera and Cyrene. Thus many of
the heroes celebrated by Pindar, and many of the illustrious men
to whom he dedicates his odes, were of his own kin. Genius for
the art seems to have been hereditary in the family of Pindar, as
it was in that of Stesichorus and of Simonides; therefore, when
the youth showed an aptitude for poetry, his father readily acceded
to his wishes, and sent him to Athens to learn the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
composing for the chorus from Lasos, the then famous but now
forgotten antagonist of the bard of Ceos. Before his twentieth
year, Pindar returned to Thebes and took, it is said, instruction
from the poetesses Myrtis and Corinna. To this period of his
artistic career belongs the oft-told tale, according to which Corinna
bade her pupil interweave myths with his panegyrics, and when,
following her advice, he produced an ode in which he had exhausted
all the Theban legends, told him &#964;&#8135; &#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#8054; &#948;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#963;&#960;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#957;,
&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#956;&#8052; &#8005;&#955;&#8179; &#964;&#8183; &#952;&#965;&#955;&#8049;&#954;&#8179;&mdash;that one ought to sow with the hand and
not with the whole sack. Against both Myrtis and Corinna, Pindar
entered the lists of poetical contest. Corinna is reported to
have beaten him five times, and never to have been vanquished by
her more illustrious rival. Pausanias hints that she owed her victories
to her beauty, and to the fact that she wrote in a broad
&AElig;olic dialect, more suited to the ears of her judges than Pindar's
Doric style. The same circumstance which insured her this temporary
triumph may have caused her ultimate neglect. The fragment
we possess of Corinna&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#956;&#8051;&#956;&#966;&#959;&#956;&#951; &#948;&#8050; &#954;&#8052; &#955;&#953;&#947;&#959;&#8059;&#961;&#945;&#957; &#924;&#959;&#8059;&#961;&#964;&#953;&#948;' &#7985;&#8061;&#957;&#947;&#945;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"I blame the clear-voiced Myrtis for that, a woman, she contended
against Pindar," is curiously at variance with her own practice.
Its &AElig;olisms prove how local and provincial her language must
have been.</p>

<p>The history of Pindar's life is the record of his poetical compositions.
He was essentially a professional artist, taking no active
part in politics, and studying to perfect his poetry all through
the perilous days of Salamis and Plat&aelig;a&mdash;like Michael Angelo,
who went on modelling and hewing through the sack of Rome,
the fall of Florence, the decline of Italian freedom, with scarce a
word to prove the anguish of his patriot soul. Pindar, unl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>ike his
fellow-countrymen, did not side with the Persians, but felt enthusiasm
for Athens, the &#7956;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#945; &#7965;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#948;&#959;&#962; (buttress of Hellas), as he
calls her in a dithyramb<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> (Fr. iv.). For this he was made Proxenos
of Athens, and received a present of 10,000 drachmas. It is said
that the Thebans fined him for his implied reflections upon them,
and that Athens paid the debt. These facts, if true, testify to the
post of honor which a mighty poet occupied in Hellas, when the
<i>vox et pr&aelig;terea nihil</i> of a bard, inspired indeed by Muses, but dependent
on a patron for his bread, was listened to with such jealous
ears by the rulers of great cities. The last Isthmian ode
shows in what a noble spirit Pindar felt the dangers of Hellas
during her deadly strife with Persia, and how he could scarcely
breathe for anxiety until the stone of Tantalus suspended over her
had been arrested. In the Proemium he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For Cleander and his prime of beauty let some one, O ye youths, bear the
glorious meed of toil to the splendid portals of his sire Telesarchus, the revel-song,
which pays him for his Isthmian victory and for his might in Nemean
games. For him I too, though grieved in soul, am asked to call upon the
golden Muse. Freed as we are from mighty griefs, let us not fall into the
bereavement of victorious crowns, nor nurse our cares; but ceasing from vain
sorrows, spread we honeyed song abroad thus after our great trouble: forasmuch
as of a truth some god hath turned aside the stone of Tantalus which
hung above our heads&mdash;intolerable suffering for Hellas. Me verily the passing
away of dread hath cured not of all care; yet it is ever better to notice
what is present: for treacherous time is hung above the lives of men, rolling
the torrent of their days. Still, with freedom on our side, men can cure even
these evils; and it is our duty to attend to wholesome hope."</p></div>

<p>Pindar passed his time chiefly at Thebes, where his home was.
But he also visited the different parts of Greece, frequently staying
at Delphi, where the iron chair on which he sat and sang was
long preserved; and also journeying to the houses of his patrons&mdash;Hiero
of Syracuse, and presumably Theron of Agrigentum, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>perhaps, too, Alexander of Macedon. Olympia must have often
received him as a guest, as well as the island of &AElig;gina, where he
had many friends. Odes were sent by him to Cyrene, to Ceos, to
Rhodes&mdash;on what tablets, we may wonder, adorned with what
caligraphy from Pindar's stylus, in what casket worthy of the
man who loved magnificence? The Rhodians inscribed his seventh
Olympian&mdash;the most radiant panegyric of the sea-born isle
of Helios&mdash;in letters of gold on the walls of their temple of the
Lindian Athene. In the midst of his artistic labors, and while
serving many patrons, Pindar, as we shall see, preserved his dignity
and loftiness of moral character.</p>

<p>Pindar is said to have died in the theatre at Argos, in the arms
of Theoxenos, a youth whom he loved passionately, and whom he
has praised in the most sublime strains for his beauty in a scolion,
the fragment of which we possess.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Anacreon choked by a
grape-stone; Sophocles breathing out his life together with the
pathetic lamentations of Antigone; &AElig;schylus killed on the sea-shore
by the eagle whose flight he had watched; Empedocles committing
his fiery but turbid spirit to the flames of Etna; Sappho
drowning her sorrows in the surf of the Leucadian sea; Ibycus, the
poet-errant, murdered by land-robbers; Euripides torn to pieces
like his own Pentheus; Archilochus honored in his death by an
oracle that cursed his battle-foe; Pindar, amid the plaudits of the
theatre, sinking back into the arms of his Theoxenos and dying in
a noontide blaze of glory&mdash;these are the appropriate and dramatic
endings which the literary gossips among the Greeks, always inventively
ingenious, ascribed to some of their chief poets. <i>Se
non son veri, son ben trovati.</i></p>

<p>Some purely legendary details show the estimation in which</p>

<p>Pindar was held by his countrymen. Multitudes of bees are said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>to have settled on his lips when he was an infant. Pan chose a
hymn of his and sang it on the mountains, honoring a mortal
poet with his divine voice. The Mother of the gods took up her
dwelling at his door. Lastly, we have the famous story of the
premonition of his death in dreams&mdash;a legend of peculiar significance,
when we remember that Pindar, like Sir Thomas Browne,
believed that "we are more than ourselves in our sleep," and wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">All by happy fate attain<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The end that frees them from their pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the body yields to death,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But the shape of vital breath<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Still in life continueth;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">It alone is heaven's conferring:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sleeps it when the limbs are stirring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when they sleep, in many dreams it shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coming consummation both of joys and woes.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Just before his death, then, Pindar sent to inquire of the oracle
of Ammon what was best for man; and the answer, which he had
already himself anticipated in his commemoration of Trophonius
and Agamedes, was&mdash;Death. Meanwhile Persephone appeared to
him in his sleep, and told him that he should praise her in her
own realm, although on earth he had left her, alone of the blest
gods, unsung. Ten days afterwards he died. The hymn which
Pindar composed for Persephone in Hades was dictated to a Theban
woman by his ghost&mdash;so runs the tale&mdash;and written down.
After his death, Pindar received more than heroic honors. They
kept his iron chair at Delphi; and the priest of Ph&#339;bus, before he
shut the temple gates, cried, "Let Pindar the poet go into the banquet
of the god." At Athens his statue was erected at the public
cost. At Thebes his house was spared in the ruin of two sieges:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lift not thy spear against the Muse's bower;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The great Emathian conqueror bid spare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house of Pindarus, when temple and tower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went to the ground.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At Rhodes, as we have seen, an ode of his was sculptured on the
temple walls of Pallas. Throughout the future, as long as Greek
poetry endured, he was known emphatically by the title of &#8001; &#955;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#962;.</p>

<p>Pindar was famous, as these semi-mythical stories about his infancy
and old age indicate, for piety. Unlike Horace, who calls
himself <i>Parcus deorum cultor et infrequens</i>, Pindar was a devout
and steadfast servant of his country's gods. He dedicated a
shrine or &#956;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8182;&#959;&#957; near his own house to the Mother of the gods,
a statue to Zeus Ammon in Libya, and one to Hermes in the
Theban agora. The whole of his poetry is impregnated with a
lively sense of the divine in the world. Accepting the religious
traditions of his ancestors with simple faith, he adds more of
spiritual severity and of mystical morality than we find in Homer.
Yet he is not superstitious or credulous. He can afford to criticise
the myths like Xenophanes and Plato, refusing to believe
that a blessed god could be a glutton. In Pindar, indeed, we see
the fine flower of Hellenic religion, free from slavish subservience
to creeds and ceremonies, capable of extracting sublime morality
from mythical legends, and adding to the old glad joyousness of
the Homeric faith a deeper and more awful perception of superhuman
mysteries. The philosophical scepticism which in Greece,
after the age of Pericles, corroded both the fabric of mythology
and the indistinct doctrines of theological monotheism, had scarcely
yet begun to act.</p>

<p>Passing to the poetry of Pindar, we have a hard task before us.
What can be said adequate to such a theme? What can be left
unsaid of the many thoughts that ought to be expressed? At the
time of Pindar's youth, lyrical poetry in Greece was sinking into
mannerism. He, by the force of his originality, gave it a whol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>ly
new direction, and, coming last of the great Dorian lyrists, taught
posterity what sort of thing an ode should be. The grand pre-eminence
of Pindar as an artist was due in a great measure to his
personality. Frigid, austere, and splendid; not genial like that
of Simonides, not passionate like that of Sappho, not acrid like
that of Archilochus; hard as adamant, rigid in moral firmness,
glittering with the strong keen light of snow; haughty, aristocratic,
magnificent&mdash;the unique personality of the man Pindar, so
irresistible in its influence, so hard to characterize, is felt in every
strophe of his odes. In his isolation and elevation Pindar stands
like some fabled heaven-aspiring peak, conspicuous from afar,
girdled at the base with ice and snow, beaten by winds, wreathed
round with steam and vapor, jutting a sharp and dazzling outline
into cold blue ether. Few things that have life dare to visit him
at his grand altitude. Glorious with sunlight and with stars,
touched by rise and set of day with splendor, he shines when
other lesser heights are dulled. Pindar among his peers is solitary.
He had no communion with the poets of his day. He is
the eagle; Simonides and Bacchylides are jackdaws. He soars
to the empyrean; they haunt the valley mists. Noticing this
rocky, barren, severe, glittering solitude of Pindar's soul, critics
have not unfrequently complained that his poems are devoid of
individual interest. Possibly they have failed to comprehend and
appreciate the nature of this sublime and distant genius, whose
character, in truth, is just as marked as that of Dante or of Michael
Angelo.</p>

<p>Since I have indulged in one metaphor in the vain attempt to
enter into some <i>rapport</i> with Pindar, let me proceed to illustrate
the Pindaric influence&mdash;the impression produced by a sympathetic
study of his odes upon the imagination saturated with all that
is peculiar in his gorgeous style&mdash;by the deliberate expansion of
some similes, which are by no means mere ornaments of rhetoric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>,
but illustrations carefully selected from the multitude of images
forced upon the mind during a detailed perusal of his poetry.
One of the common names for Pindar is the Theban Eagle. This
supplies us with the first image, which may be conveyed in the
very words of Dante:<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In dreams I seemed to see an eagle hovering in air on wings of gold,
with pinions spread and ready to swoop. I thought I was on the spot where
Ganymede was taken from his comrades and borne aloft to the celestial
consistory. I pondered&mdash;peradventure the great bird only strikes this hill,
and peradventure scorns to snatch elsewhere his prey. Then it seemed to
me that, after wheeling a while, it swooped, terrible like lightning, and caught
me up into the sphere of flame; and there I thought that it and I both burned;
and so fiercely did the fire in my imagination blaze, that sleep no longer
could endure, but broke."</p></div>

<p>This simile describes the rapidity and fierceness of Pindar's spirit,
the atmosphere of empyreal splendor into which he bears us with
strong wings and clinging talons. Another image may be borrowed
from Horace,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> who says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fervet immensusque ruit profundo Pindarus <em class="gesperrt">ore</em>;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>likening the poet to a torrent, unrestrained, roaring to the woods
and precipices with a thunderous voice. This image does not,
like the other, fix our attention upon the quality peculiar to Pindar
among all the poets of the world&mdash;splendor, fire, the blaze of
pure effulgence. But it does suggest another characteristic, which
is the stormy violence of his song, that chafes within its limits
and seems unable to advance quickly enough in spite of its speed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>This violence of Pindar's style, as of some snow-swollen Alpine
stream, the hungry Arve or death-cold Lutschine, leaping and
raging among granite boulders, has misled Horace into the notion
that Pindar's odes are without metrical structure:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">numerisque fertur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lege solutis:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>whereas we know that, while pursuing his eagle-flight to the sun,
or thundering along his torrent-path, Pindar steadily observed the
laws of strophe, antistrophe, and epode with consummate art. A
third figure may be chosen from Pindar<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As when a man takes from his wealthy hand a goblet foaming with the
dew of the grape, and gives it with healths and pledges to his youthful son-in-law
to bear from one home to the other home, golden, the crown of his possessions,
gracing the feast and glorifying his kinsman, and makes him in the
eyes of the assembled friends to be admired for his harmonious wedlock: so
I, sending outpoured nectar, the Muse's gift, to conquering heroes, the sweet
fruit of the soul, greet them like gods, victors at Olympia and Pytho."</p></div>

<p>Then, too, he adds: "With the lyre and with the various voices
of flutes<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> I have come with Diagoras across the sea, chanting
the wave-born daughter of the Cyprian goddess and the bride of
Helios, island Rhodes." In this passage we get a lively impression
of some of the marked qualities of Pindar. Reading his poetry
is like quaffing wine that bubbles in a bowl of gold. Then,
too, there is the picture of the poet, gorgeously attired, with his
singing-robes about him, erect upon the prow of a gilded galley,
floating through dazzling summer-waves towards the island of his
love, Rhodes or Sicily or &AElig;gina. The lyre and the flute send
their clear sounds across the sea. We pass temple and citadel on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>shore and promontory. The banks of oars sweep the flashing
brine. Meanwhile the mighty poet stretches forth his golden
cup of song to greet the princes and illustrious athletes who
await him on the marble quays. Reading Pindar is a progress
of this pompous kind. Pindar, as one of his critics remarks, was
born and reared in splendor; splendor became his vital atmosphere.
The epithet &#966;&#953;&#955;&#8049;&#947;&#955;&#945;&#959;&#962;, which he gives to Girgenti, suits
himself. The splendor-loving Pindar is his name and title for all
time. If we search the vocabulary of Pindar to find what phrases
are most frequently upon his lips, we shall be struck with the
great preponderance of all words that indicate radiance, magnificence,
lustre. To Pindar's soul splendor was as elemental as harmony
to Milton's. Of the graces, Aglaia must have been his favorite.
Nor, love as he did the gorgeousness of wealth, was it
mere transitory pomp, the gauds and trappings of the world,
which he admired. There must be something to stir the depths
of his soul&mdash;beauty of person, or perfection of art, or moral radiance,
or ideal grandeur. The blaze of real magnificence draws
him as the sun attracts the eagle; he does not flit moth-like about
the glimmer of mere ephemeral lights.</p>

<p>After these three figures, which illustrate the fiery flight, the
torrent-fulness, the intoxicating charm of Pindar, one remains by
which the magnetic force and tumult of his poetry may be faintly
adumbrated. He who has watched a sunset attended by the
passing of a thunderstorm in the outskirts of the Alps; who has
seen the distant ranges of the mountains alternately obscured by
cloud and blazing with the concentrated brightness of the sinking
sun, while drifting scuds of hail and rain, tawny with sunlight,
glistening with broken rainbows, clothe peak and precipice and
forest in the golden veil of flame-irradiated vapor; who has heard
the thunder bellow in the thwarting folds of hills, and watched
the lightning, like a snake's tongue, flicker at intervals amid gl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>oom
and glory&mdash;knows in Nature's language what Pindar teaches with
the voice of Art. It is only by a strained metaphor like this that
any attempt to realize the <i>Sturm und Drang</i> of Pindar's style
can be communicated. In plainer language, Pindar, as an artist,
combines the strong flight of the eagle, the irresistible force of
the torrent, the richness of Greek wine, the majestic pageantry of
Nature in one of her sublimer moods.</p>

<p>Like all the great lyrists of the Dorian school, Pindar composed
odes of various species&mdash;hymns, prosodia, parthenia, threnoi, scolia,
dithyrambs, as well as epinikia. Of all but the epinikian odes
we have only inconsiderable fragments left; yet these are sublime
and beautiful enough to justify us in believing that Pindar surpassed
his rivals in the threnos and the scolion as far as in the
epinikian ode. Forty-four of his poems we possess entire&mdash;fourteen
Olympians, twelve Pythians, eleven Nemeans, seven Isthmians.
Of the occasions which led to the composition of these odes
something must be said. The Olympian games were held in Elis
once in five years, during the summer: their prize was a wreath
of wild olive. The Pythian games were held in spring, on the
Criss&aelig;an plain, once in five years: their prizes were a wreath of
laurel and a palm. The Nemean games were held in the groves
of Nemea, near Cleon&aelig;, in Argolis, once in three years: their
prize was a wreath of parsley. The Isthmian games were held
at Corinth, once in three years: their prize was a wreath of pine,
native to the spot. The Olympian festival honored Zeus; that
of Pytho, Ph&#339;bus; that of Nemea, Zeus; that of the Isthmus,
Poseidon. Originally they were all of the nature of a &#960;&#945;&#957;&#8053;&#947;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#962;
or national assembly at the shrine of some deity local to the spot,
or honored there with more than ordinary reverence. The Isthmian
games in particular retained a special character. Instituted
for an Ionian deity, whose rites the men of Elis refused to acknowledge,
they failed to unite the whole Greek race. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Greek games, like the Schwing-feste and shooting-matches of
Switzerland, served as recurring occasions of reunion and fellowship.
Their influence in preserving a Panhellenic feeling was
very marked. During the time of the feast, and before and after,
for a sufficient number of days, to allow of travellers journeying
to and from Olympia and Delphi, hostilities were suspended
throughout Hellas; safe-conduct was given through all states to
pilgrims. One common feeling animated all the Greeks at these
seasons: they met in rivalry, not of arms on the battle-field, but
of personal prowess in the lists. And though the various families
of the Hellenic stock were never united, yet their games gave
them a common object, and tended to the diffusion of national
ideas.</p>

<p>Let us pause to imagine the scene which the neighborhood of
Olympia must have presented as the great recurring festival of
the Greek race approached&mdash;a festival in the fullest sense of the
word popular, but at the same time consecrated by religion, dignified
by patriotic pride, adorned with art. The full blaze of summer
is overhead; plain and hill-side yield no shade but what the spare
branches of the olive and a few spreading pines afford. Along
the road throng pilgrims and deputies, private persons journeying
modestly, and public ambassadors gorgeously equipped at the expense
of their state. Strangers from Sicily or Cyrene or Magna
Gr&aelig;cia land from galleys on the coast of Elis. Then there are the
athletes with their trainers&mdash;men who have been in rude exercise
for the prescribed ten months, and whose limbs are in the bloom
of manly or of boyish strength. Sages, like Gorgias or Prodicus
or Protagoras, are on their way, escorted by bands of disciples,
eager to engage each other in debate beneath the porticos of the
Olympian Zeus. Thales or Anaxagoras arrives, big with a new
theory of the universe. Historians like Herodotus are carrying
their scrolls to read before assembled Hellas. Epic poets a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>nd
rhapsodes are furnished with tales of heroes, freshly coined from
their own brains or conned with care from Homer. Rich men
bring chariots for racing or display; the more a man spends at
Olympia, the more he honors his native city. Women, we need
not doubt, are also on the road&mdash;Hetair&aelig; from Corinth and Cyprus
and Ionia. Sculptors show models of their skill. Potters
exhibit new shapes of vases, with scrolls of honeysuckle wreathing
round the pictured image of some handsome boy, to attract
the eyes of buyers. Painters have their tablets and colors ready.
Apart from these more gay and giddy servants of the public taste,
are statesmen and diplomatists, plenipotentiaries despatched to feel
the pulse of Hellas, negotiators seeking opportunities for safe discussion
of the affairs of rival cities. Every active brain, or curious
eye, or wanton heart, or well-trained limb, or skilful hand, or
knavish wit may find its fit employment here. A medi&aelig;val pilgrimage
to St. James of Compostella or St. Thomas of Canterbury
was nothing to this exodus of wit in Greece.</p>

<p>As they approached Olympia, a splendid scene burst upon the
travellers' eyes&mdash;the plain of Elis, rich, deep-meadowed, hoary
with olive-trees. One cried to the other, There is the hill of
Cronion! There is the grove of Altis! Thither flows Alpheus
to the sea! Those white and glittering statues are the portraits
of the victors! That temple is the house of everlasting Zeus;
beneath its roof sits the Thunderer of Pheidias! Every step
made the journey more exciting. By the bed of the Alpheus,
tawny in midsummer with dusty oleander-blossoms, the pilgrims
passed. At last they enter the precincts of Olympian Zeus: the
sacred enclosure is alive with men; the statues among the trees
are scarcely more wonder-worthy in their glittering marble than
are the bodies of the athletes moving beneath them. The first
preoccupation of every Greek who visited Olympia was to see the
statue of Zeus. Not to have gazed upon this masterpiece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Pheidias was, according to a Greek proverb, the unhappiness of
life. In this, his greatest work, the Athenian sculptor touched
the highest point of art, and incarnated the most sublime conception
of Greek religious thought. The god was seated on his
throne; but, even so, the image rose to the height of forty feet,
wrought of pure ivory and gold. At his feet stood figures symbolical
of victory in the Olympian games: among them the portrait
of Pantarkes, himself a victor, the youth whom Pheidias
loved. In designing his great statue the sculptor had in mind
those lines of Homer which describe Zeus nodding his ambrosial
locks, and shaking Olympus. That he had succeeded in presenting
to the eye all that the Greek race could imagine of godlike
power and holiness and peace was attested not only by the universal
voice of Hellas, but also by the Romans who gazed as conquerors
upon the god. Lucius Paulus &AElig;milius, we are told, after
the battle of Pydna, swept Greece, and coming to Olympia, saw
the Pheidian Zeus. He shuddered, and exclaimed that he had
set mortal eyes upon the deity incarnate. Yet Paulus was a Roman
trampling with his legionaries the subject states of fallen
Hellas. Cicero proclaimed that Pheidias had copied nothing human,
but had carved the ideal image existing in an inspired mind.</p>

<p>Zeus, it must be remembered, was the supreme god of the Aryan
race, the purest divinity of the Greek cultus. He was called
Father, Sire of gods and men. Therefore his presence in the
Panhellenic temple was peculiarly appropriate and awe-inspiring.
We may imagine the feelings of an athlete coming to struggle
for the fame of his own city, when he first approached this statue
in the august Olympian shrine. The games were held at the time
of a full moon; through the hyp&aelig;thral opening of the temple
roof fell the silver rays aslant upon those solemn lineaments, making
the glow of ivory and gold more solemn in the dimness of a
wondrous gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>Presidents chosen from the people of Elis, and named Hellanodikai,
awarded the prizes and controlled the conduct of the
games. From their decision, in cases of doubt, there was a final
appeal to the assembly of Elis. In the morning the heralds
opened the lists with this proclamation:<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> "Now begins the contest
that dispenses noblest prizes; time tells you to delay no longer."
When the runners were ready, the heralds started them
with these words, "Put your feet to the line and run." At the
end of the day they cried, "Now ceases the contest that dispenses
noblest prizes; time tells you to delay no longer." The victor
was crowned with wild olive, and led by his friends to the Temple
of Zeus. On the way they shouted the old Archilochian chorus,
&#964;&#8053;&#957;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#8055;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#949;, to which Pindar alludes in the beginning
of his 9th Olympian: "The song of Archilochus uttered at Olympia,
the triple cry of Hail Victorious! was enough to conduct
Epharmostus, leading the revel to the Cronian hill with his comrades.
But now, from the far-darting bows of the Muses, approach
Zeus of the blazing thunder and the holy jutting land of
Elis with these mightier shafts." Sacrifice and banquet took
place in the evening; and happy was the athlete who, in this supreme
moment, was greeted by Pindar with attendant chorus and
musicians of the flute and lyre. Three Olympians, which seem to
have been composed and chanted on the spot, survive&mdash;the 4th,
the 8th, the 10th. The proemia to these odes, two of which are
remarkably short, indicating the haste in which they had been
prepared, sufficiently establish this fact. "Supreme hurler of the
thunderbolt that never tires, Zeus! Thy festival recurring with
the season brings me with sound of lyre and song to witness august
games." "Parent of golden-crowned contests, Olympia, mistress
of truth," etc. But it could not be expected that the more
elaborate of Pindar's compositions should be ready on such occasions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>It usually happened that the victor either found Pindar
at Olympia, or sent a message to him at Thebes, and bespoke an
ode, adding gifts in accordance with the poet's rank and fame.
Then Pindar composed his epinikian, which was sung when the
conqueror returned to his own city. The ode would be repeated
on successive anniversaries at banquets, sacrificial festivals, and
processions in honor of the victory. The ninth Olympian, which
has been already quoted, was, for example, sung at a banquet in
honor of Epharmostus of Opus, after the altar of Ajax, son of
O&iuml;leus, had been crowned. Pindar, as we find from frequent allusions
in the odes, had such a press of work that he often delayed
sending his poems at the proper time, and had to excuse himself
for neglect. In the second Isthmian he records a delay of two
years. We may add that he did not disdain to accept money for
his toil. In the eleventh Pythian he says: "Muse, it is thy part,
since thou hast contracted to give thy voice for gold, to set it
going in various ways." In the proemium to the second Isthmian
he somewhat bitterly laments the necessity that made him sell
his songs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The men of old, Thrasybulus, who climbed the chariot of the gold-crowned
Muses, and received a famous lyre, lightly shot their arrows of honey-voiced
hymns in praise of boys, of him whose beauty kept the summer bloom of
youth, that sweetest souvenir of Aphrodite throned in joy. For the Muse as
yet loved not gain, nor worked for hire, nor were sweet and tender songs with
silvered faces sold by Terpsichore. But now she bids us keep the Argive's
speech in mind; and verily it hits the truth&mdash;that money, money, money makes
the man. He spoke it when deserted of his riches and his friends."</p></div>

<p>Yet we must not suppose that Pindar sang slavishly the praise
of every bidder. He was never fulsome in his panegyric. He
knew how to mingle eulogy with admonition. If his theme be
the wealth of a tyrant like Hiero, he reminds him of the dangers
of ambition and the crime of avarice. Arcesilaus of Cyrene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> is
warned<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> to remit his sentence of banishment in favor of a powerful
exile. Victors, puffed up with the pride of their achievements,
hear from him how variable is the life of man, how all
men are mere creatures of a day. Handsome youths are admonished
to beware of lawlessness and shun incontinence. Thus
Pindar, while suiting his praises to the persons celebrated, always
interweaves an appropriate precept of morality. There was nothing
that he hated more than flattery and avarice, and grasping
after higher honors than became his station. In him more than
in any other poet were apparent the Greek virtues of &#949;&#8016;&#954;&#959;&#963;&#956;&#8055;&#945;,
&#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;, and all the moral and artistic qualities which were
summed up in the motto &#956;&#951;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#957;.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Those who are curious
to learn Pindar's opinions on these points may consult the following
passages:<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Nem. viii. 32; id. vii. 65; Pyth. xi. 50; Isthm.
vii. 40; id. v. 14; and, lastly, Pyth. x. 22, which contains this
truly beautiful description of a thoroughly successful life, as imagined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>by a Greek:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"That man is happy and song-worthy by the skilled, who, victorious by
might of hand or vigor of foot, achieves the greatest prizes with daring and
with strength; and who in his lifetime sees his son, while yet a boy, crowned
happily with Pythian wreaths. The brazen heaven, it is true, is inaccessible
to him; but whatsoever joys we race of mortals touch, he reaches to the
farthest voyage."</p></div>

<p>With this we may compare the story of happy lives told by
Cr&#339;sus to Solon, and the celebrated four lines of Simonides:
"Health is best for a mortal man; next, beauty; thirdly, well-gotten
wealth; fourthly, the pleasure of youth among friends."</p>

<p>Closely connected with Pindar's ethical beliefs were his religious
notions, which were both peculiar and profound. Two
things with regard to his theology deserve especial notice&mdash;its
conscious criticism of existing legends, and its strong Pythagorean
bias, both combined with true Hellenic orthodoxy in all
essentials. One of the greatest difficulties in forming an exact
estimate of the creed of a philosophical Greek intellect is to know
how to value the admixture of scientific scepticism on the one
hand, and of purer theism on the other. About Pindar's time
the body of Hellenic mythology was being invaded by a double
process of destructive and constructive criticism. Xenophanes,
for example, very plainly denounced as absurd the anthropomorphic<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pantheon made in the image of man, while he endeavored</span><br />
to substitute a cult of the One God, indivisible and incognizable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>Plato still further developed the elements suggested by Xenophanes.
But there was some inherent incapacity in the Greek intellect
for arriving at monotheism by a process of rarefaction and
purification. The destructive criticism which in Xenophanes,
Pindar, and Plato had assailed the grosser myths, dwindled into
unfruitful scepticism. The attempts at constructing a rational
theosophy ended in metaphysics. Morality was studied as a
separate branch of investigation, independent of destructive criticism
and religious construction. Meanwhile the popular polytheism
continued to flourish, though enfeebled, degenerate, and
disconnected from the nobler impulses of poetry and art. In
Pindar the process of decadence had not begun. He stood at
the very highest point which it was possible for a religious Greek
to reach&mdash;combining the &aelig;sthetically ennobling enthusiasm for
the old Greek deities with so much critical activity as enabled
him to reject the grosser myths, and with that moderate amount
of theological mysticism which the unassisted intellect of the
Greeks seemed capable of receiving without degeneracy into puerile
superstition. The first Olympian ode contains the most
decided passages in illustration of his critical independence of
judgment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Impossible is it for me to call one of the blessed ones a glutton: I stand
aloof: loss hath often overtaken evil speakers."</p></div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Truly many things are wonderful; and it may be that in some cases fables
dressed up with cunning fictions beyond the true account falsify the traditions
of men. But beauty, which is the author of all delicious things for
mortals, by giving to these myths acceptance, ofttimes makes even what is
incredible to be credible: but succeeding time gives the most certain evidence
of truth; and for a man to speak nobly of the gods is seemly; for so the
blame is less."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p></div>

<p>These two passages suffice to prove how freely Pindar handled
the myths, not indeed exposing them to the corrosive action of
mere scepticism, but testing them<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> by the higher standard of the
healthy human conscience. When he refuses to believe that the
immortals were cannibals and ate the limbs of Pelops, he is like
a rationalist avowing his disbelief in the savage doctrine of eternal
damnation. His doubt does not proceed from irreligion, but
from faith in the immutable holiness of the gods, who set the
ideal standard of human morality. What seems to him false in
the myths he attributes to the accretions of ignorant opinion and
vain fancy round the truth.</p>

<p>The mystical element of Pindar's creed, whether we call it Orphic
or Pythagorean, is remarkable for a definite belief in the
future life, including a system of rewards and punishments; for
the assertion of the supreme tribunal of conscience,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and, finally,
for a reliance on rites of purification. The most splendid passage
in which these opinions are expressed by Pindar is that
portion of the second Olympian in which he describes the torments
of the wicked and the blessings of the just beyond the
grave:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Among the dead, sinful souls at once pay penalty, and the crimes done in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>this realm of Zeus are judged beneath the earth by one who gives sentence
under dire necessity.</p>

<p>"But the good, enjoying perpetual sunlight equally by night and day, receive
a life more free from woes than this of ours; they trouble not the earth
with strength of hand, nor the water of the sea for scanty sustenance; but
with the honored of the gods, all they who delighted in the keeping of their
oath pass a tearless age: the others suffer woe on which no eye can bear to
look. Those who have thrice endured on either side the grave to keep their
spirits wholly free from crime, journey on the road of Zeus to the tower of
Kronos: where round the islands blow breezes ocean-borne; and flowers of
gold burn some on the land from radiant trees, and others the wave feeds;
with necklaces whereof they twine their hands and brows, in the just decrees
of Rhadamanthus, whom father Kronos has for a perpetual colleague, he who
is spouse of Rhea throned above all gods.</p>

<p>"Peleus and Cadmus are numbered among these: and thither was Achilles
brought by his mother when she swayed the heart of Zeus with prayer:
he who slew Hector, the invincible firm pillar of Troy, and gave Cycnus to
death and Eo's &AElig;thiopian son."</p></div>

of weal or woe:</p>

<p>For Pindar's conception of the destinies of frail humanity, take
this sublime but melancholy ending to an ode<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> which has been
full of triumphant exultation: "Brief is the growing-time of joy
for mortals, and briefly, too, doth its flower fall to earth shaken
by fell fate. Things of a day! what are we&mdash;and what are we
not! A shadow's dream is man. But when the splendor that
God gives descends, then there remains a radiant light and gladsome
life for mortals." Compare with this the opening of the
sixth Nemean:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"One is the race of men, and one the race of gods; from one mother we
both draw breath. But a total difference of force divides us, since man's
might is naught, while brazen heaven abideth a sure seat for aye. Nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>we are not all unlike immortals either in our mighty soul or strength of
limb, though we know not to what goal of night or day fate hath written
down for us to run."</p></div>

<p>Passing to the consideration of Pindar purely as an artist, we
may first examine the structure of his odes, and then illustrate
the qualities of his poetry by reference to some of the more splendid
proemia and descriptions. The task which lay before him
when he undertook to celebrate a victory at one of the Greek
games was this: Some rich man had won a race with his chariot
and horses, or some strong man had conquered his competitors
by activity or force of limb. Pindar had to praise the rich man
for his wealth and liberality, the strong man for his endurance of
training and personal courage or dexterity. In both cases the
victor might be felicitated on his good-fortune&mdash;on the piece of
luck which had befallen him; and if he were of comely person
or illustrious blood, these also offered topics for congratulation.
The three chief commonplaces of Pindar, therefore, are &#8004;&#955;&#946;&#959;&#962;,
&#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8053;, &#949;&#8016;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945;, wealth or prosperity, manliness or spirit, and blessings
independent of both, god-given, not acquired. But it could
not be that a great poet should ring the changes only on these
three subjects, or content himself with describing the actual contest,
which, probably, he had not witnessed. Consequently Pindar
illustrates his odes with myths or stories bearing more or less
closely on the circumstances of his hero. Sometimes he celebrates
the victor's ancestry, as in the famous sixth Olympian, in
which the history of the Iamid&aelig; is given; sometimes his city, as
in the seventh Olympian, where he describes the birthplace of
Diagoras, the island Rhodes; sometimes he dwells upon an incident
in the hero's life, as when in the third Pythian the illness of
Hiero suggests the legend of Asclepius and Cheiron; sometimes
a recent event, like the eruption of Etna, alluded to in the first
Pythian, gives color to his ode; sometimes, as in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> the
last Pythian, where the story of Medusa is narrated, the legendary
matter is introduced to specialize the nature of the contest. The
victory itself is hardly touched upon: the allusions to &#8004;&#955;&#946;&#959;&#962;, &#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8053;,
&#949;&#8016;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#8055;&#945;, though frequent and interwoven with the texture of
the ode, are brief: the whole poetic fabric is so designed as to be
appropriate to the occasion and yet independent of it. Therefore
Pindar's odes have not perished with the memory of the
events to which they owed their composition.</p>

<p>Pindar's peculiar treatment of the epinikian ode may best be
illustrated by analyzing the structure of one or two of his poems.
But first take this translation of one of the shorter and simpler
of the series&mdash;the twelfth Pythian:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To thee, fairest of earthly towns, I pray&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou splendor-lover, throne of Proserpine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Great queen, to take this Pythian crown and own<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Midas; for he of all the Greeks, thy son,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Here it will be seen that Pindar introduces his subject with a
panegyric of Girgenti, his hero's birthplace. Then he names
Midas, and tells the kind of triumph he has gained. This leads
him to the legend of Medusa. The whole is concluded with moral
reflections on the influence of fate over human destinies. The
structure of the sixth Pythian is also very simple. "I build an
indestructible treasure-house of praise for Xenocrates (lines 1-18),
which Thrasybulus, his son, gained for him; as Antilochus died
for Nestor (19-43), so Thrasybulus has done what a son could
do for his father (44-46); wise and fair is he in his youth; his
company is sweeter than the honeycomb" (47-54). One of the
longest odes, the fourth Pythian, is constructed thus: "Muse!
celebrate Arcesilaus (1-5). Cyrene, Arcesilaus's home; its foundation
and the oracle given to Battus (5-69). The tale of the
Argonauts, ancestors of the founders of Thera and of Cyrene
(69-262). Advice to Arcesilaus in the interest of Demophilus"
(263-299). Here the victory at Pytho is but once briefly alluded
to (l. 64). The whole ode consists of pedigree and political admonition,
either directly administered at the end, or covertly conveyed
through the example of Pelias. The sixth Olympian, which
contains the pedigree of the Iamid&aelig;, is framed on similar principles.
The third Pythian introduces its mythology by a different
method: "I wish I could restore Cheiron, the healer and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
tutor of Asclepius, to life (1-7). The story of Coronis, her son
Asclepius, and Hippolytus (7-58). Moral, to be content and submit
to mortality (58-62). Yet would that Cheiron might return
and heal Hiero (62-76)! I will pray; and do you, Hiero, remember
that Heaven gives one blessing and two curses, and that
not even Cadmus and Peleus were always fortunate (77-106).
May I suit myself always to my fortune!" (107-115). The
whole of this ode relates to Hiero's illness, and warns him of
vicissitudes: even the episode of Coronis and Asclepius contains
a covert warning against arrogance, while it gracefully alludes to
Hiero's health.</p>

<p>The originality and splendor of Pindar are most noticeable in
the openings of his odes&mdash;the proemia, as they are technically
called. It would appear that he possessed an inexhaustible storehouse
of radiant imagery, from which to draw new thoughts for
the commencement of his poems. In this region, which most
poets find but barren, he displayed the fullest vigor and fertility
of fancy. Sometimes, but rarely, the opening is simple, as in the
second Olympian: "Hymns that rule the lyre! what god, what
hero, what man shall we make famous?" Or the ninth Pythian:
"I wish to proclaim, by help of the deep-girdled Graces, brazen-shielded
Telesicrates, Pythian victor," etc. Rather more complex
are the following: Nem. iv., "The joy of the feast is the best
physician after toil; but songs, the wise daughters of the Muses,
soothe the victor with their touch: warm water does not so refresh
and supple weary limbs as praise attended by the lyre;" or
again: Ol. xi., "There is a time when men have greatest need of
winds; there is when heaven's showers of rain, children of the
cloud, are sorest sought for. But if a man achieves a victory
with toil, then sweet-voiced hymns arise as the beginning of future
fame," etc., etc. But soon we pass into a more gorgeous
region. "As when with golden columns reared beneath the well-wal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>led
palace-porch we build a splendid hall, so will I build my
song. At the beginning of the work we must make the portal
radiant."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Or again: "No carver of statues am I, to fashion
figures stationary on their pedestal; but come, sweet song! on
every argosy and skiff set forth from &AElig;gina to proclaim that
Pytheas, Lampon's son, by strength of might is victor in Nemean
games, upon whose chin and cheek you see not yet the tender
mother of the vine-flower, summer's bloom."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Or again: "Hallowed
bloom of youth, herald of Aphrodite's ambrosial pleasures,
who, resting on the eyelids of maidens and of boys, bearest one
aloft with gentle hands of violence, but another rudely!"<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Or
once again, in a still grander style:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Listen! for verily it is of beauty's queen, or of the Graces, that we turn
the glebe, approaching the rocky centre of the deep-voiced earth: where for
the blest Emmenid&aelig; and stream-washed Acragas, yea, and for Zenocrates, is
built a treasure-house of Pythian hymns in the golden Apollonian vale. This,
no rain of winter, driving on the wings of wind the pitiless army of the rushing
cloud, no hurricane shall toss, storm-lashed with pebbles of the uptorn
beach, into the briny ocean caves; but in pure light its glorious face shall
speak the victory that brings a common fame on thy sire, Thrasybulus, and
thy race, remaining in the windings of Crissean valleys."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p></div>

<p>We have already seen how Pindar compares his odes to arrows,
to sun-soaring eagles, to flowers of the Muses, to wine in golden
goblets, to water, to a shrine which no years will fret away. Another
strange figure<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> may be quoted from the third Nemean
(line 76): "I send to thee this honey mingled with white milk;
the dew of their mingling hangs around the bowl, a draught of
song, flowing through the &AElig;olian breath of flutes." It will be
perceived that to what is called confusion of metaphors Pindar
shows a lordly indifference. Swift and sudden lustre, the luminousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>of a meteor, marks this monarch of lyric song. He
grasps an image, gives it a form of bronze, irradiates it with the
fire of flame or down-poured sunlight.</p>

<p>To do justice to Pindar's power of narrative by extracts and
translations is impossible. No author suffers more by mutilation
and by the attempt to express in another language and another
rhythm what he has elaborately fashioned. Yet it may be allowed
me to direct attention to the rapidity with which the burning of
Coronis (Pyth. iii. 38) and the birth of Rhodes from the sea (Ol.
vii. 54) are told in words the grandest, simplest, and most energetic
that could be found. This is the birth of Iamos (Ol. vi.
39):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Homeward from rocky Pytho, to his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called all his household, asking of the son<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>After so much praise of Pindar's style, it must be confessed
that he has faults. One of these is notoriously tumidity&mdash;an
overblown exaggeration of phrase. For example, when he wants
to express that he cannot enlarge on the fame of &AElig;gina, but will
relate as quickly as he can the achievements of Aristomenes which
he has undertaken, he says: "But I am not at leisure to consecra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>te
the whole long tale to the lyre and delicate voice, lest satiety
should come and cause annoy; but that which is before my
feet shall go at running speed&mdash;thy affair, my boy&mdash;the latest of
the noble deeds made winged by means of my art."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The imaginative
force which enabled him to create epithets like &#934;&#953;&#955;&#8049;&#947;&#955;&#945;&#959;&#962;,
&#960;&#945;&#956;&#960;&#8057;&#961;&#966;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;, and to put them exactly in their proper places,
like blocks of gleaming alabaster or of glowing porphyry&mdash;for
the architectural power over language is eminent in Pindar; the
Titanic faculty of language which produced such phrases as &#7952;&#958; &#7936;&#948;&#8049;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7970;
&#963;&#953;&#948;&#8049;&#961;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#949;&#967;&#8049;&#955;&#954;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#956;&#8051;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#8055;&#945;&#957; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#961;&#8119; &#966;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8055;, did
also betray him into expressions as pompous and frigid as these:
&#960;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#966;&#8057;&#961;&#956;&#953;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#8118;&#962; ... &#963;&#967;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#964;&#8051;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#8049; &#964;' &#7936;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#8048; &#948;&#953;&#952;&#965;&#961;&#8049;&#956;&#946;&#969;&#957;.
These, poured forth by Pindar in the insolence of prodigality,
when imitated by inferior poets, produced that inflated manner
of lyrical diction which Aristophanes ridicules in Kinesias. The
same may be said about his mixed metaphors, whereof the following
are fair examples:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Nor are these the worst, perhaps, of the sort which might be
chosen: for Pindar uses images like precious stones, setting them
together in a mass, without caring to sort them, so long as they
produce a gorgeous show. Apparent incoherences, involving difficulty
to the reader, and producing a superficial effect of obscurity,
constitute another class of his alleged faults&mdash;due partly to
his allusive and elliptical style, partly to his sudden transitions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>partly to the mixture of his images. Incapable of what is commonplace,
too fiery to trudge, like Simonides, along the path of
rhetorical development, infinitely more anxious to realize by audacity
the thought that seizes him than to make it easy to his
hearer, Pindar is obscure to all who are unwilling to assimilate
their fancy to his own. La Harpe called the Divine Comedy <i>une
amplification stupidement barbare</i>: what, if he had found occasion
to speak the truth of his French mind, would he have said
about the Odes of Pindar? Another difficulty, apart from these
of verbal style and imagination, is derived from the fact that the
mechanism of Pindar's poetry, carefully as it is planned, is no less
carefully concealed. He seems to take delight in trying to solve
the problem of how slight a suggestion can be made to introduce
a lengthy narrative. The student is obliged to maintain his attention
at the straining-point if an ode of Pindar's, even after
patient analysis, is to present more than a mass of confused
thoughts and images to his mind. But when he has caught the
poet's drift, how delicate is the machinery, how beautiful is the
art, which governs this most sensitive fabric of linked melodies!
What the hearers made of these odes&mdash;the athletes for whom they
were written, the handsome youths praised in them, the rich men
at whose tables they were chanted&mdash;remains an impenetrable mystery.
Had the Greek race perceptions infinitely finer than ours?
Or did the classic harmonies of Pindar sweep over their souls,
ruffling the surface merely, but leaving the deeps untouched, as
the soliloquies of <i>Hamlet</i> or the profound philosophy of <i>Troilus
and Cressida</i> must have been lost upon the groundlings of Elizabeth's
days, who caught with eagerness at the queen's poisoned
goblet or the by-play of Sir Pandarus? That is a problem we
cannot solve. All we know for certain is, that even allowing for
the currency of Pindar's language and for the familiarity of his
audience with the circumstances under which his odes were compos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>ed,
as well as with their mythological allusions, these poems
must at all times have been more difficult to follow than Bach's
fugue in G minor to a man who cannot play the organ.</p>

<p>&AElig;schylus, son of Euphorion, was born at Eleusis in 525 B.C.
When he was thirty-five years of age, just ten years after the production
of his first tragedy, he fought at Marathon. This fact is
significant in its bearing on his art and on his life. &AElig;schylus
belonged to a family distinguished during the decisive actions of
the Persian war by their personal bravery. Ameinias, his brother,
gained the <i>aristeia</i>, or reward for valor, at the battle of Salamis;
and there was an old picture in the theatre of Dionysus at
Athens which represented the great deeds of the poet and his
brother Cyn&aelig;geirus at Marathon. Of his military achievements
he was more proud than of his poetical success; for he menti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>ons
the former and is silent about the latter in the epitaph he wrote
for his own tomb. Of his actual life at Athens, we only know
this much, that he sided with the old aristocratic party. His retirement
to Sicily after his defeat by Sophocles in 468 B.C. arose
probably from the fact that Cimon, who adjudged the prize, was
leader of the democratic opposition, and was felt to have allowed
his political leanings to influence his decision. His second retirement
to Sicily in 453 B.C., after the production of the <i>Oresteia</i>,
in which he unsuccessfully supported the Areiopagus against
Pericles, was due, perhaps, in like manner to his disagreement
with the rising powers in the State. That at some period of his
career he was publicly accused of impiety, because he had either
divulged the mysteries of Demeter, or had offended popular taste
by his presentation of the <i>Furies</i> on the stage, rests upon sufficient
antique testimony. Such charges were not uncommon at
Athens, as might be proved by the biographies of Anaxagoras
and Socrates. But the exact nature of the prosecution directed
against &AElig;schylus is not known; we cannot connect it with any
of his extant works for certain, or determine how far it affected
his action. He died at Gela, in 456 B.C., aged sixty-nine, having
spent his life partly at Athens and partly at the court of Hiero,
pursuing in both places his profession of tragic poet and chorus-master.</p>

<p>Pausanias tells a story of his early vocation to dramatic art:
"When he was a boy he was set to watch grapes in the country,
and there fell asleep. In his slumber Dionysus appeared to him,
and ordered him to apply himself to tragedy. At daybreak he
made the attempt, and succeeded very easily." There is no reason
that this legend should not have been based on truth. It was
the general opinion of antiquity that &AElig;schylus was a poet possessed
by the deity, working less by artistic method than by immediate
inspiration. Athen&aelig;us asserts crudely that he composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
his tragedies while drunk with wine: &#956;&#949;&#952;&#8059;&#969;&#957; &#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#7956;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#949; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#8179;&#948;&#8055;&#945;&#962;;
and Sophocles is reported to have told him that "He did
what he ought to do, but did it without knowing." Longinus, in
like manner, after praising &AElig;schylus for the audacity of his imagination
and the heroic grandeur of his conceptions, adds that
his plays were frequently unpolished, unrefined, ill-digested, and
rough in style. Similar expressions of opinion might be quoted
from Quintilian, who describes his style "as sublime and weighty,
and grandiloquent often to a fault, but in most of his compositions
rude and wanting in order." He adds that "the Athenians
allowed later poets to correct his dramas and to bring them into
competition under new forms, when many of them gained prizes."
&AElig;schylus seems, therefore, to have impressed critics of antiquity
with the god-intoxicated passion of his genius rather than with
the perfection of his style or the consummate beauty of his art.
It is possible that he received less justice from his fellow-countrymen
than we, who have been educated by the Shakespearian
drama, can now pay him.</p>

<p>&AElig;schylus might be selected to illustrate the artistic psychology
of Plato. In the <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i> Plato lays down the doctrine that poetic
inspiration is akin to madness&mdash;an efflation from the Muses,
a divine mania analogous to love. In the <i>Ion</i> he further develops
this position, and asserts that "all good poets compose their beautiful
poems not as works of art, but because they are inspired and
possessed." The analogy which he selects is drawn from the behavior
of Bacchantes under the influence of Dionysus. He wishes
to distinguish between the mental operations of the poet and
the philosopher, to show that the regions of poetry and science
are separate, and to prove that rule and method are less sure
guides than instinct when the work to be produced is a poem.
"The poet is a light and winged and holy thing, and there is no
invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>s
senses, and the mind is no longer in him; when he has not attained
to this state, he is powerless and is unable to utter his oracles."
The final dictum of the <i>Ion</i> is, "inspiration, not art"&mdash;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8052; &#964;&#949;&#967;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#957;. It is curious to find a Greek of the best
age, himself in early days a poet, and throughout distinguished by
genius allied to the poetic, thus boldly and roundly stating a theory
which corresponds to the vulgar notion that poetry comes by
nature, untutored and untaught, and which seems to contradict
the practice and opinion of supreme authorities like Sophocles
and Goethe. The truth is, that among artists we find two broadly
differentiated types. The one kind produce their best work
when all their faculties are simultaneously excited, and when the
generative impulse takes possession of them. They seem to obey
the dictates of a power superior to their ordinary faculties. The
other kind are always conscious of their methods and their aims;
they do nothing, as it were, by accident; they avoid improvisation,
and subordinate their creative faculty to reason. The laws
of art may be just as fully appreciated by the more instinctive
artists, and may have equally determined their choice of form
and their calculation of effects; but at the moment of production
these rules are thrust into the background, whereas they are continually
present to the minds of the deliberate workers. It may
be said in passing that this distinction enables us to understand
some phrases which the Italians, acutely sensitive to artistic conditions,
have reserved for passionate and highly inspired workers;
they speak, for instance, of painting a picture or blocking out a
statue <i>con furia</i>, when the artist is a Tintoretto or a Michael Angelo.
If there is any truth at all in this analysis, we are justified
in believing that &AElig;schylus belonged to the former and Sophocles
to the latter class of poets, and that this is the secret of the criticism
passed by Sophocles upon his predecessor. The account
which &AElig;schylus himself gave of his tragedies throws no light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
upon his method; he is reported to have said that they were
"fragments picked up from the mighty feasts of Homer." The
value he attached to them is proved by his saying that he dedicated
what he wrote to Time.</p>

<p>Though the ancients may have been right in regarding &AElig;schylus
as an enthusiastic writer, obeying the impulse of the god within
him rather than the rules of reason, no dramatic poet ever had
a higher sense of the &aelig;sthetic unity which tragedy demands.
Each of his masterpieces presents to the imagination a coherent
and completely organized whole; every part is penetrated with
the dominant thought and passion that inspired it. He had,
moreover, the strongest sense of the formal requirements of his
art. Tragedy had scarcely passed beyond the dithyrambic stage
when he received it from the hands of Phrynichus. &AElig;schylus
gave it the form which, with comparatively unimportant alterations,
it maintained throughout the brilliant period of Attic culture.
It was he who curtailed the function of the chorus and
developed dialogue, thus expanding the old Thespian elements of
tragedy in accordance with the true spirit of the drama. By adding
a second actor, by attending diligently to the choric songs
and dances, by inventing the cothurnus and the tragic mask, and
by devising machinery and scenes adapted to the large scale of
the Athenian stage, he gave its permanent form to the dramatic
art of the Greeks. However god-possessed he may have been
during the art of composition, he was therefore a wise critic and a
potent founder in all matters pertaining to the theatre. Yet
though &AElig;schylus in this way made the drama, the style in which
he worked went out of date in his own lifetime. So rapid was
the evolution of intelligence at Athens that during a single generation
his tragedies became, we will not say old-fashioned, but archaic.
They were duly put upon the stage; a chorus at the public
expense was provided for their representation, and the MS.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
which authorized their canon and their text was regarded as a
public treasure. Yet the Athenians already had come to love and
respect them in the same way as the English race love and respect
the oratorios of Handel. They praised them for their unapproachable
magnificence; they knew that no man of the latter
days could match them in their own kind; but they criticised
their antique form and obsolete embellishments. The poet who
in his youth had played the part of innovator, and who had
shocked the public by his realistic presentation of the Furies, depended
in the heyday of the fame of Aristophanes upon conservative
support and favor.</p>

<p>&AElig;schylus was essentially the demiurge of ancient art. The
purely creative faculty has never been exhibited upon a greater
scale, or applied to material more utterly beyond the range of
feebler poets. He possessed in the highest degree the power of
giving life and form to the vast, the incorporeal, and the ideal. In
his dramas, mountains were made to speak; Oceanus received
shape, conversing face to face with the Titan Prometheus, while
his daughters, nurslings of the waves and winds, were gathered on
the Scythian crags in groups to listen to their argument. The
old intangible, half-mystical, half-superstitious fears of the Greek
conscience became substantial realities in his mind. Justice and
Insolence and At&eacute; no longer floated, dream-like, in the background
of religious thought: he gave them a pedigree, connected them in
a terrible series, and established them as ministers of supreme
Zeus. The Eumenides, whom the Greeks before him had not
dared to figure to their fancy, assumed a form more hideous than
that of Gorgons or Harpies. Their symbolic torches, their snake-entwined
tresses, their dreadful eyes, and nostrils snorting fiery
breath, were shown for the first time visibly in the trilogy of
<i>Orestes</i>. It was a revelation which Greek art accepted as decisive.
Thus the imagination of &AElig;schylus added new deities to the Athen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>ian
Pantheon. The same creative faculty enabled him to inform
elemental substances, fire, water, air, with personal vitality. The
heaven, in his verse, yearns to wound the earth with love-embraces;
the falling rain impregnates the rich soil. The throes of
&AElig;tna are a Titan's groaning. The fire that leaps from Ida to the
Herm&aelig;an crags of Lemnos, from &AElig;giplanctus to the Arachn&aelig;an
height, has life within it. There is nothing dead, devoid of soul,
in the world of this arch-mythopoet. Even the ghosts and phantoms,
dreams and omens, on which he loves to dwell, are substantial.
Their reality exists outside the soul they dominate.</p>

<p>As befits a demiurgic nature, &AElig;schylus conceived and executed
upon a stupendous scale. His outlines are huge; his figures are
colossal; his style is broad and sweeping&mdash;like a river in its fulness
and its might. Each of his plays might be compared to a
gigantic statue, whereof the several parts, taken separately, are
beautiful, while the whole is put together with majestic harmony.
But as the sculptor, in modelling a colossus, cannot afford to introduce
the details which would grace a chimney ornament, so
&AElig;schylus was forced to sacrifice the working-out of minor motives.
His imagination, penetrated through and through with the
spirit of his subject as a whole, was more employed in presenting
a series of great situations, wrought together and combined into a
single action, than in elaborating the minuti&aelig; of characters and
plots. The result has been that those students who delight in
detail have complained of a certain disproportion between his
huge design and his insufficient execution. It has too frequently
been implied that he could rough-hew like a Cyclops, but that he
could not finish like a Praxiteles; that he was more capable of
sketching in an outline than of filling up its parts. Fortunately
we possess the means of laying bare the misconception upon
which these complaints are founded. There still remains one, but
only one, of his colossal works entire. The <i>Oresteia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> is sufficient
to prove that we gain no insight into his method as an artist if
we consider only single plays. He thought and wrote in trilogies.
Sophocles, with whom it is usual to compare &AElig;schylus,
somewhat to the disadvantage of the latter, abandoned the large
scale, the uncial letters, of the trilogy. Each separate Sophoclean
drama is a studied whole. In order to do &AElig;schylus the very
barest justice, we ought therefore to contrast, not the <i>Agamemnon</i>
alone, but the entire <i>Oresteia</i> with the <i>&#338;dipus</i> or the <i>Antigone</i>.
It will then be seen that the one poet, designing colossi, gave
them the style and finish and the unity which suit a statue larger
than life-size; the other, restricting himself within more narrow
limits, was free to lavish labor on the slightest details of his model.
Such elaboration, on the scale adopted by &AElig;schylus, would
have produced a bewildering and painful effect of complexity.
The vast design, which it was the artist's object to throw into the
utmost possible relief, would inevitably have suffered from excess
of finish.</p>

<p>Few dramatists have ventured, like &AElig;schylus, to wield the chisel
of a Titan, or to knead whole mountains into statues corresponding
to the superhuman grandeur of their thought. Few, indeed,
can have felt that this was their true province, that to this
they had the thews and sinews adequate. He stands alone in his
triumphant use of the large manner, and this solitude is prejudicial
to his fame with students whose taste has been formed in
the school of Sophocles. Surveying the long roll of illustrious
tragedians, there is but one, until we come to Victor Hugo, in
whom the &AElig;schylean spirit found fresh incarnation; and he had
fallen upon days disadvantageous to his full development: his life
was cut short in its earliest bloom, and the conditions under which
he had to work, obscure and outcast from society, were adverse to
the highest production. This poet is our own Christopher Marlowe.
Like &AElig;schylus, Marlowe's imagination was at home in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
illimitable; like &AElig;schylus, he apprehended immaterial and elemental
forces&mdash;lusts, ambitions, and audacities of soul&mdash;as though
they were substantial entities, and gave them shape and form;
like &AElig;schylus, he was the master of a "mighty line," the maker
of a new celestial music for his race, the founder and creator of
an art which ruled his century, the mystagogue of pomps and
pageants and things terrible and things superb in shrines unvisited
by earlier poets of his age and clime; like &AElig;schylus, he stands
arraigned of emptiness, extravagance, and "sound and fury," because
the scale on which he wrought was vast, because he set no
verbal limit to the presentation of the passion or the thought in
view. Comparing &AElig;schylus to Marlowe is comparing the monarch
of the pine forest to the sapling fir, the full-grown lion to
the lion's whelp, the achievement of the hero to the promise of
the stripling. Yet Herakles in his cradle, when he strangled
Hera's serpents, already revealed the firm hand and unflinching
nerve of him who plucked the golden fruit of the Hesperides.
Even so Marlowe's work betrays the style and spirit of a youthful
Titan; it is the labor of a beardless &AElig;schylus, the first-fruit of
Apollo's laurel-bough untimely burned, the libation of a consecrated
priest who, while a boy, already stood "chin-deep in the
Pierian flood." If we contrast the <i>Supplices</i>, which &AElig;schylus can
hardly have written before the age at which Marlowe died, with
<i>Tamburlaine</i>, which was certainly produced before Marlowe was
twenty-six, the most immature work of the Greek with the most
immature work of the English dramatist, we obtain a standard for
estimating the height to which the author of <i>Faustus</i> might have
grown if he had lived to write his <i>Oresteia</i> in the fulness of a vigorous
maturity.</p>

<p>Much that has been described as Asiatic in the genius of &AElig;schylus
may be referred to what I have called his demiurgic force.
No mere citation of Oriental similes will account for the i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>mpression
of hugeness left upon our memory, for the images enormous
as those of farthest Ind, yet shaped with true Hellenic symmetry,
for the visions vast as those of Ezekiel, yet conveyed withal in
rich and radiant Greek. The so-called Asiatic element in &AElig;schylus
was something which he held in common with the poets and
prophets of the East&mdash;a sense of life more mystic and more deep,
a power to seize it and discover it more real and plastic than is
often given to the nations of the West. This determination towards
the hitherto invisible, unshaped, and unbelieved, to which he
must give form, and for which he would fain win credence, may
possibly help to explain the absence of human love as a main motive
in his tragedies. There is plenty of Ares&mdash;too much, indeed,
unless we recollect that the poet was a man of Marathon&mdash;but of
Aphrodite nothing in his inspiration. It would seem that this
passion, which formed the theme of Euripides' best work, and
which Sophocles in the <i>Antigone</i> used to enhance the tragic situation
brought about through the self-will of the heroine, had no
attraction for &AElig;schylus. Among the fragments of his plays there
is, indeed, one passage in which he speaks of love as a cosmical
force, controlling the elemental powers of heaven and earth, and
producing the flocks and fruits which sustain mortal life. The
lines in question are put into the mouth of Aphrodite. The lost
<i>Myrmidones</i>, again, described the love of Achilles for Patroclus,
which &AElig;schylus seems to have portrayed with a strength of passion
that riveted the attention of antiquity. The plot of the <i>Supplices</i>,
in like manner, implies the lawless desire of the sons of
&AElig;gyptus for the daughters of Danaus; and the adultery of Clytemnestra
with &AElig;gisthus lies in the background of the <i>Agamemnon</i>.
But of love in the more romantic modern sense of the
word we find no trace either in the complete plays or in the fragments
of &AElig;schylus. It lay, perhaps, too close at hand for him to
care to choose it as the theme of tragic poetry; and, had he so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
selected it, he could hardly have avoided dwelling on its aberrations.
The general feeling of the Greeks about love, as well as
his own temper, would have made this necessary. It did not occur
to the Greeks to separate love in its healthy and simple manifestations
by any sharp line of demarcation from the other emotions
of humanity. The brotherly, filial, and wifely feelings&mdash;those
which owe their ascendency to use and to the sanctities of
domestic life&mdash;appeared in their eyes more important than the
affection of youth for maid unwedded. When love ceased to be
the expression on the one side of a physical need, and on the other
the binding tie that kept the family together, the Greeks regarded
it as a disease, a madness. Plato, who treated it with seriousness,
classed it among the &#956;&#8049;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#953;. Euripides portrayed it as
a god-sent curse on Ph&aelig;dra. Viewed in this light, it may be
urged that the love of Zeus for Io, in the <i>Prometheus</i>, is an example
of a passion which became an unbearable burden and source
of misery to its victim; but of what we understand by love there
is here in reality no question. The tale of Io rather resembles
the survival of some mystic Oriental myth of incarnation.</p>

<p>The organic vitality which &AElig;schylus, by the exercise of his
creative power, communicated to the structure of his tragedies,
is further noticeable in his power of conducting a drama without
prologue and without narration. In &AElig;schylus, the information
that is necessary in order to place the spectators at the proper
point of view is conveyed as part of the action. He does not,
like Euripides, compose a formal and preliminary speech, or, like
Shakespeare, introduce two or three superfluous characters in conversation.
In this respect the openings of the <i>Prometheus</i>, the
<i>Agamemnon</i>, and the <i>Eumenides</i> are masterpieces of the most
consummate art. Not only are we plunged <i>in medias res</i>, without
the slightest sacrifice of clearness, but the spectacle presented
to our imagination is stirring in the highest degree. The fire has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
leaped from mountain peak to peak until at last it blazes on the
watchman's eyes; Heph&aelig;stus and his satellites are actually engaged
in nailing down the Titan to his bed of pain; the Furies
are slumbering within the sacred Delphian shrine, and the ghost
of Clytemnestra moves among them, rousing each in turn from
her deep trance. Euripides, proceeding less by immediate vision
than by patient thought, prefixed a monologue, which contained
a programme of preceding events, and prepared the spectator for
what would follow in the play. These narratives are often frigid,
and not unfrequently are placed, without propriety, in the mouth
of one of the actors. We feel that a wholly detached prologue
would have been more artistic.</p>

<p>The same is true about the speeches of the Messenger. The
art of &AElig;schylus was far too highly organized to be obliged to
have recourse to such rude methods. It is true that, when he
pleased, as in the <i>Pers&aelig;</i>, he gave the principal part to the Messenger.
The actors in that play are little better than spectators;
and the same may be said about the <i>Seven against Thebes</i>. But
the Messenger, though employed as here for special purposes, was
no integral part of his dramatic machinery; nor did he ever commit
the decisive event of the drama to narration. His master-stroke
as a dramatic poet&mdash;the cry of Agamemnon, following
close upon the prophecies of Cassandra, and breaking the silence
like a clap of doom, in that awful moment when the scene is left
empty and the chorus tremble with the apprehension of a coming
woe&mdash;would probably have yielded in the hands of Euripides to
the speech of a servant. It was not that the later poet would not
willingly have employed every means in his power for stirring
the emotions of his audience; but he had not the creative imagination
of his predecessor; he could not grasp his subject as a
whole so perfectly as to dispense with artificial and mechanical
devices. He fell back, therefore, upon narrative, in wh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>ich he was
a supreme master.</p>

<p>Equally remarkable from this point of view is the &AElig;schylean
treatment of the Chorus. It is never really separated from the
action of the play. In the <i>Prometheus</i>, for example, the Oceanid&aelig;
actually share the doom of the protagonist. In the <i>Supplices</i> the
daughters of Danaus may be termed the protagonist; for upon
them converges the whole interest of the drama. In the <i>Seven
against Thebes</i> the participation of the Chorus in the fate of the
chief actors is proved by half of them siding with Ismene and
the other half with Antigone at the conclusion. In the <i>Pers&aelig;</i>
they represent the nation which has suffered through the folly of
Xerxes. In the <i>Agamemnon</i> the elders of Mycen&aelig; assume an attitude
directly hostile to &AElig;gisthus and Clytemnestra. In the
<i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i> the women who sympathize with Electra further the
scheme of Orestes by putting &AElig;gisthus off the track of danger
and sending him unarmed to meet his murderers. In the <i>Eumenides</i>
the Furies play a part at least equal in importance to that
of Orestes. They, like the protagonist, stand before the judgment-seat
of Pallas and accept the verdict of the Areiopagus.
Thus, in each of the extant plays of &AElig;schylus, even the Chorus,
which was subsequently so far separated from the action as to become
a mere commentator and spectator, is vitally important in
the conduct of the drama. Euripides, by formalizing the several
elements of the tragic art, by detaching the Chorus, introducing a
prologue, and expanding the functions of the Messenger, sacrificed
that higher kind of unity which we admire in the harmonious
working of complex parts. What he gained was the opportunity
of concentrating attention upon the conflict of motives, occasions
for the psychological analysis of character, and scope for ethical
reflection and rhetorical description.</p>

<p>I have hitherto been occupied by what <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>appear to me the essential
features of the genius of &AElig;schylus&mdash;its demiurgic faculty of
creativeness, and its capacity of dealing with heroic rather than
merely human forms. To pass to the consideration of his theology
would at this point be natural and easy. I do not, however,
wish to dwell on what is called the prophetic aspect of his
tragedy at present. It is enough to say that, here, as in the sphere
of pure art, he was in the truest sense creative. Without exactly
removing the old landmarks, he elevated the current conception
of Zeus regarded as the supreme deity, and introduced a novel
life and depth of meaning into the moral fabric of the Greek religion.
Much as he rejoiced in the delineation of Titanic and
primeval powers, he paid but slight attention to the minor gods
of the Pantheon; his creed was monotheism detached upon a
pantheistic background, to which the forms of polytheism gave
variety and color. Zeus was all in all for &AElig;schylus far more than
for his predecessors, Homer and Hesiod. The most remarkable
point about the &AElig;schylean theology is that, in spite of its originality,
it seems to have but little affected the substance of serious
Greek thought. Plato, for example, talks of Prometheus in the
<i>Protagoras</i> as if no new conception of his character had been revealed
to him by &AElig;schylus. We are not, therefore, justified in
regarding the dramatic poet as in any strict sense a prophet, and
the oracles he uttered are chiefly valuable as indications of his
own peculiar ways of thinking; nor ought we, even so, perhaps,
to demand from &AElig;schylus too much consistency. The <i>Supplices</i>,
for instance, cannot without due reservation be used to illustrate
the <i>Prometheus</i>; since the dramatic situation in the two tragedies
is so different as to account for any apparent divergence of
opinion.</p>

<p>There is, however, one point in the morality of &AElig;schylus concerning
fate and freewill which calls for special comment, since
we run a danger here of doing real violence to his art by overstating
some one theory about his supposed philosophical intenti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>on.
I allude, of course, to his conception of destiny. If we
adopt the fatalistic explanation of Greek tragedy propounded by
Schlegel, we can hardly avoid coarsening and demoralizing fables
which owe their interest not to the asphyxiating force of destiny,
but to the action and passion of human beings. If, on the other
hand, we overstrain the theological doctrine of Nemesis, we run a
risk of trying to find sermons in works of art, and of exaggerating
the importance of details which support our favorite hypothesis.
It should never be forgotten that whatever view we take of the
moral and religious purpose of Greek tragedy has been gained
by subsequent analysis. It was not in any case present to the
consciousness of the poet as a necessary condition of his art as
art. His first business was to provide for the dramatic presentation
of his subject: his philosophy, whether ethical or theological,
transpired in the heat and stress of production, not because
he sought to give it deliberate expression, but because it formed
an integral part of the fabric of his mind. &AElig;schylus, in common
with the Greeks of his age, firmly believed in the indissoluble
connection between acts and consequences, and in the continuation
of these consequences through successive generations. "Whatsoever
a man soweth that shall he also reap," "the fathers have
eaten a sour grape and the children's teeth are set on edge,"
formed the groundwork of his view of human life. This sort of
fatalism he colored with religious theories adopted from the antique
theology of his race, but strongly moralized and developed
in the light of his own reason. The importance attributed by the
Greeks to hereditary curses, even in the common affairs of life, is
proved by the familiar example of the proclamation by the Spartans
against Pericles in the first year of the Peloponnesian War.
Much of elder superstition, therefore, clings about his ethics, and
an awful sense of guilt and doom attaches to acts in themselves
apparently indifferent; nor can we fail to recognize a belief in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
fate as fate, &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#949;&#960;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#957;, superior to all besides. The realm of
tragic terror lies precisely in this border-land between inexorable
reason and unreasoned fear. It has nothing to do with pure science
or pure religion: they speak each for themselves with their
own voice; but it is not the voice of the dramatist. On the one
hand, logical fatalism offers no freedom for the play of character,
no turning-points of choice, no revolutions which may rouse our
sympathy and stir us with the sense of self-determined ruin. On
the other hand, theology, in its methodic form, supplies, indeed,
the text of sermons, admonitions, and commandments, but not
the subject-matter for a work of art. Where the necessity of circumstance
or the will of the Deity is paramount, human action
sinks into insignificance; the canons of inevitable sequence and
of obedience under pain of penalty supersede the casuistry of balanced
motives, and the poet is swallowed up in the divine or the
logician. Somewhere between the two, in the intermediate darkness,
or &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#8055;&#967;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#963;&#954;&#8057;&#964;&#959;&#962;, where all the ways of life are perilous,
and where no clear light reveals the pitfalls of fate and the gins
of religious duty, lies the track of the tragedian. His men and
women are free; yet their action is overruled by destiny. They
err against the law of heaven and flourish for a season; but the
law pursues them and enacts its penalty. While terror and pity
are stirred by the pervading sense of human helplessness, scope is
still left for the exercise of the moral judgment; nor is the poet
precluded from teaching his audience by precept and example.
These remarks apply to the domestic curse which played so prominent
a part in all Greek tragedy, and especially in the dramas of
&AElig;schylus. It was no mere avalanche of doom falling from above
and crushing the innocent and the criminal alike; nor, again, can
it justly be paralleled by what it most resembles, the taint of
hereditary disease. It partook of the blind force of fate; it was
propagated from generation to generation by laws analogous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
those which govern madness; yet it contained another element,
inasmuch as the transgression of each successive victim was a
necessary condition of its prolongation. Sin alone, however, was
not sufficient to establish its mysterious power; for all men are
liable to offend against the divine law, and yet all families are not
afflicted with a curse. In order to appreciate its nature, all these
factors must be taken into account; their sum total, notwithstanding
the exactitude of our calculation, remains within the
realm of mystery. The undiscovered residuum, or rather the resolution
of all these elements in a power which is all of them and
more than all, is fate. Students who are curious to appreciate the
value attached by the Greeks themselves to the several elements
implicit in the notion of domestic At&eacute;, should attentively peruse
the longer of the two arguments to the <i>Seven against Thebes</i>,
while the play itself sets forth more energetically than any other
the terrible lesson of the &AElig;schylean Nemesis. The protagonist
Eteocles is a curse-intoxicated man, driven by the doom of his
race and by the imprecations of his father on a dreadful shoal of
fate. He walks open-eyed to meet his destiny&mdash;to slay his brother
and be slain. Still, helpless as he seems, he is not innocent.
His own rebellious and selfish nature, by rousing the fury of &#338;dipus,
kindles afresh the smouldering flame of the ancestral At&eacute;.
Thus the fate which overwhelms him is compounded of hereditary
guilt, personal transgression, and the courage-quelling terror of a
father's curse. But it is more than all this: it is an irresistible
compelling force. He cannot avoid it, since action has been
thrust upon him by the strength of circumstance. The tragic
horror of his situation arises from the necessity under which he
labors of going forward, though he knows that the next step leads
to a bottomless abyss.</p>

<p>In estimating the char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>acters of &AElig;schylus, what has already been
said about his art in general must be taken into account. He
was occupied with the task of exhibiting a great action, a &#948;&#961;&#8118;&#956;&#945;
in the strictest sense of the Greek phrase; and this action was
frequently so colossal in its relations as to preclude the niceties
of merely personal character. Persons had to become types in
order to play their part efficiently. The underlying moral and
religious idea was blended with the &aelig;sthetic purpose of the poet,
and penetrated with the interest pertaining to the clash of conflicting
principles: the total effect produced sometimes seems to
defy analysis of character in detail. The psychology of his chief
characters is, therefore, inherent in their action, and is only calculable
in connection with their momentary environments. We
have to infer their specific quality less from what they say than
from their bearing and their conduct in the crises of the drama.
Only after profound study of the situation of each tragedy, after
steeping our imagination in the elementary conditions selected by
the poet, can we realize the fulness of their individuality. In
this respect &AElig;schylus resembles Homer. Like Homer, he repeats
the work of nature, and creates men and women entire. He does
not strive to lay bare the conscious workings of the mind piecemeal.
He has none of the long speeches on which Euripides relied
for setting forth the flux and reflux of contending motives, or
for making clear the attitude adopted by his <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>.
There is no revelation of the anatomical method in his art; nor,
again, can we detect the <i>ars celandi artem</i> to which poets of a
more reflective age are forced to have recourse. Everything with
&AElig;schylus is organic; each part is subordinated to the whole
which pre-existed in his mind, and which has been evolved in its
essential unity from his imagination. Even the weighty sentences
and gnomic judgments upon human affairs, uttered by his
actors, are necessitated by the straits in which they find themselves.
Severed from their context, they lose half their value;
whereas the similar reflections in Euripides may be detached wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>thout
injury, and read like extracts from a commonplace-book.
Perhaps sufficient stress has not been laid by critics upon this
quality of absolute creativeness, which distinguishes the Homeric,
&AElig;schylean, and Shakespearian poets from those who proceed
from mental analysis to artistic presentation. It is easy to render
an account of characters that have first been thought out as ethical
specimens and then provided with a suitable exterior. It is very
difficult to dissect those which started into being by an act of intuitive
invention, and which, dissociated from the texture of circumstance
woven round them, appear at first sight to elude our
intellectual grasp. Yet the latter are found in the long run to be
cast in the more vital mould. Once apprehended, they haunt the
memory like real persons, and we may fancy, if we choose, innumerable
series of events through which they would maintain
their individuality intact. They are, in fact, living creatures, and
not puppets of the poet's brain.</p>

<p>Of the characters of &AElig;schylus, those which have been wrought
with the greatest care, and which leave the most profound impression
on the memory, are Clytemnestra and Prometheus. Considering
how slight were the outlines of the Homeric picture of
Clytemnestra, it may be said that &AElig;schylus created her. What
is still more remarkable than his creation of Clytemnestra is that
he should have realized her far more vividly than any of the men
whom he has drawn. This proves that &AElig;schylus, at least among
the Attic Greeks, gave a full share to women in the affairs of the
great world of public action. As a woman, she stands outside
the decencies and duties of womanhood, supporting herself by
the sole strength of her powerful nature and indomitable will.
The self-sufficingness of Clytemnestra is the main point in her
portrait. Her force of character is revealed by the sustained repression
of her real feelings and the concealment of her murderous
purpose, which enable her to compass Agamemnon's death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
During the critical moments when she receives her husband in
state, and leads him to the bath within the palace, she remains
calm and collected. The deed that she has plotted must, if ever,
be done at once. A single word from the Chorus, who are aware
of her relations to &AElig;gisthus, would spoil all her preparations.
Yet she shows no fear, and can command the fairest flowers of
rhetoric to greet the king with feigned congratulations. The
same strength is displayed in her treatment of Cassandra, on
whom she wastes no words, expends no irritable energy, although
she hates and has the mind to murder her. Studied craft and
cold disdain mark her bearing at the supreme crisis. When the
death-blow has been given to Agamemnon, she breathes freely;
her language reveals the exhilaration of one who expands his
lungs and opens wide his nostrils to snuff the elastic air of liberty.
The blood upon her raiment is as pleasant to her as a shower of
rain on thirsty cornfields; she shouts like soldiers when the foemen
turn to fly. &AElig;schylus has sustained the impression of her
force of character by the radiant speech with which he gifts her.
This splendor of rhetoric belongs by nature to the magnificent
and lawless woman who rejoices in her shame. It is like the
superb colors of a venomous lily. The contrast between the serpent-coils
of her sophistic speech to Agamemnon at the palace-gate
and the short sentences in which she describes his murder&mdash;true
tiger-leaps of utterance&mdash;is a triumph of dramatic art.
As regards her motive for killing the king, I see no reason to
suppose that &AElig;schylus intended to diverge from the Homeric
tradition. Clytemnestra has lived in adultery with &AElig;gisthus;
she dares not face a public discovery of her fault, nor is she willing
to forego her paramour. The passage in the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>,
where she argues with Orestes before her own murder, proves
that she has no other valid reason to set forth. Her son tells her
she shall be slain and laid by the side of &AElig;gisthus, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> that in
life she preferred him to her lord. All her answer is: "Child,
in your father's absence I was sorely tried." The same is clear
from the allusions in the <i>Agamemnon</i> to the nerveless lion, who
tumbles in the royal couch, and is a sorry housekeeper for the
departed king. &AElig;schylus, however, with the instinct of a great
poet, has not suffered our minds to dwell wholly upon this adulterous
motive. He makes Clytemnestra put forth other pleas,
and intends us to believe in their validity, as lending her self-confidence
in the commission of her crime, and as suggesting
reasons for our sympathy. Revenge for Iphigeneia's sacrifice,
the superstitious sense of the Erinnys of the house of Atreus,
jealousy of Chryseis and Cassandra, mingle with the master impulse
in her mind, and furnish her with specious arguments.
The solidity of Clytemnestra's character is impressed upon us
with a force and a reality of presentation that have never been
surpassed. She maintains the same <i>aplomb</i>, the same cold glittering
energy of speech, the same presence of mind and unswerving
firmness of nerve, whether she bandies words of bitter irony
with the Chorus, or ceremoniously receives the king, or curls the
lip of scorn at Cassandra, or defies the Argives after Agamemnon's
death. She loves power, and despises show. When the
deed is done, and fair words are no longer needed, her hypocrisy
is cast aside. At the same time she defends herself with a moral
impudence which is only equalled by her intellectual skill, and
rises at last to the sublimity of arrogance when she asserts her
right to be regarded as the incarnate demon of the house. Clytemnestra
has been frequently compared to Lady Macbeth; nor
is it easy to think of the one without being reminded of the
other. Clytemnestra, however, is a less elastic character than
Lady Macbeth: she is cast in metal of a tougher temper, and
the springs which move her are more simple. Lady Macbeth
has not in reality so much force and fibre: she does not de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>sign
Duncan's death many months beforehand; she acts from overmastering
impulse under the temptation of opportunity, and when
her husband and herself are sunk chin-deep in blood she cannot
bear the load of guilt upon her conscience. Shakespeare has
conceived and analyzed a woman more sensitive, and therefore
more liable to nervous failure, than Clytemnestra. Clytemnestra
never breaks down. Her sin feeds and nourishes her nature, instead
of starving and palsying it; her soul grows fat and prospers,
nor does she know what conscience means. She is never
more imposing in her pride of intellectual strength than when
she receives the feigned news of Orestes' death. Just as the
superior nature of Lady Macbeth is enhanced by contrast with
her weaker husband, so Clytemnestra appears to the greatest advantage
by the side of &AElig;gisthus. &AElig;gisthus in the last scene of
the <i>Agamemnon</i> brags and blusters; Clytemnestra utters no superfluous
syllable. &AElig;gisthus insults the corpse of the king; Clytemnestra
is satisfied with having slain him. Nothing shakes her
courage or weakens her determination. When Orestes turns his
sword against her in the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>, her first impulse is to call
aloud: "Reach me with all speed an axe of weight to tire a man,
that we may know at once the issue of this combat." She will
measure weapons with her son. And when his blade is already
at her breasts, she has the nerve to bare them and exclaim: "My
son, behold where thou didst lie; these nipples gave thee milk."
There is no groaning in her last life-struggle. She dies, as she
lived, self-sustained and equal to all emergencies. This terrible
personality endures even in the grave. When she rises in the
<i>Eumenides</i>, a ghost from Hades, it is with bitter taunts and a
most biting tongue that she stirs up the Furies to revenge. If
we are to seek a parallel for Clytemnestra in our own dramatic
literature, I should be inclined to look for it in the <i>Vittoria Corrombona</i>
of Webster. The modern poet has not developed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
"white devil of Italy" with the care that &AElig;schylus bestowed on
Clytemnestra. Her portrait remains a sketch rather than a finished
picture; and the circumstances of her tragedy are infinitely
less impressive than those which place the Queen of Mycen&aelig; on
so eminent a pinnacle of crime. But Vittoria is cast in the same
mould. Like Clytemnestra, she has the fascination and the force
of sin, self-satisfied and self-contained to face the world with
brazen arrogance, and browbeat truth before the judgment-seat
of gods or men.</p>

<p>Of all the masterpieces of Greek tragedy which have been preserved
to us, the <i>Prometheus</i> of &AElig;schylus presents by far the
greatest difficulty, and involves at the same time by far the most
enticing problems. Its paramount interest lies in the fact that
the dramatic action is removed beyond and above the sphere of
humanity, and that the poet, who was also the chief prophet of
Hellas in the very prime of Athenian culture, is dealing with the
mystery of God's relation to the world and man. In the trilogy
of the <i>Oresteia</i> he is concerned with heroes; in the <i>Prometheus</i>,
with gods, Titans, and demigods. The <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> are Prometheus,
Heph&aelig;stus and his comrade Force, Hermes, the herald
of Zeus, Io, the victim of the love of Zeus, and Oceanus, the ruler
of the streams and seas. The Chorus is composed of Oceanides,
the maiden daughters of the deep, cloud-bearing dews and mists,
who gather round the Scythian crags, where Prometheus lies
chained and exposed to fiery heat by day and freezing cold by
night. The only mortal who visits him is Io; and she bears
within her the child of Zeus. Thus everything in the tragedy is
conceived upon a vast and visionary scale. It is no episode of
real or legendary history which forms the subject-matter of the
play. The powers of heaven and earth are in action. The destinies
of Olympian Zeus and of the whole human race are at
stake. In this lofty region of the imagination the genius o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>f
&AElig;schylus moves freely. The scenery of his drama is in harmony
with its stupendous subject. Barren mountain-summits,
the sea outspread beneath, the sky with all its stars above, silently
falling snow-flakes and tempestuous winds, thunder and earthquake
and riven precipices are the images which crowd upon the
mind. In like manner the duration of time is indefinitely extended.
Not years, but centuries, measure the continuance of the
struggle between the sovereign will of Zeus and the stubborn resistance
of the Titan.</p>

<p>At the opening of the play Prometheus appears in the midst
of the desert which is destined for his prison-home. Heph&aelig;stus
and his satellites chain him down with adamantine rivets, so that
he may neither bend the knee nor rest in slumber, but must cling,
crucified in wakeful torment, to the unyielding rock. While they
are at their work, Prometheus utters not a word or groan. He is
gifted with unerring foresight, and knows surely that his doom
must be borne, and also that his doom must have an end. He
defies the power of Zeus in frigid silence; not sullenly&mdash;because,
when sympathy has loosed his lips, he proves that a warm heart
beats within his breast&mdash;but proudly and indignantly. Heph&aelig;stus
and Titanic Force leave him alone in his misery when their
task is finished. Then at last he speaks. It is to the kindred
powers of elemental nature, to the Sun and Sea and nourishing
Earth, his brethren and his mother, that he addresses his complaint:
"See you how I, a god, suffer at the hands of God; and
for what crime?&mdash;<i>for having given fire to mortal man</i>."</p>

<p>This, then, is the sin of Prometheus. He found humanity abject
and forsaken by the gods. Zeus, who had recently seized
upon the empire of the universe, designed to extirpate men from
the world, and to create a new race after his own heart. Prometheus
took pity upon them, saved them from destruction, gifted
them with fire, the mother of all arts, taught them carpentry <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>and
husbandry, revealed to them the stars, whereby they knew the
order of the seasons and recurrences of crops, instructed them in
letters, showed them how to tame the horse and ox, and how to
plough the sea with ships, then taught them medicine and the cure
of wounds, then divination and the sacrifice of victims to propitiate
the gods, and lastly how to smelt the ore contained within
the bowels of the earth. All these good things Prometheus gave
to men. And here, in passing, we may notice how accurately
&AElig;schylus has sketched the primitive conditions of mankind in its
emergence from the state of savagery. The picture is, indeed,
poetical; but subsequent knowledge has only strengthened the
outlines and filled them in with details, not altered or erased them.</p>

<p>Now, however, we ask, In what true sense was Prometheus
criminal? What right had Zeus, who is invariably represented
by &AElig;schylus in all his other dramas as a just and wise ruler, to
impose these trials on the benefactor of the human race? &AElig;schylus,
in this play, clearly desires to rouse our sympathy for Prometheus.
He makes all the principal actors speak of Zeus as a forceful
tyrant, newly come to power, which he abuses for his selfish
ends, subverting the old order of the world, oppressing the old
powers, who are his kindred, yet substituting nothing but his own
ill-regulated and capricious will. On the other hand, &AElig;schylus
has indicated that Prometheus is in the wrong; that he regards
his disobedience to Zeus as the cause of merited punishment.
The Chorus points this moral by asserting, in spite of their tender
feeling for the Titan, that they only are sane and righteous who
bow to necessity and accept the law of their superior. Oceanus,
in like manner, advises his kinsman to submit; and reminds him
that, though the rule of Zeus is a novelty, it is not intolerable,
and that acquiescence is always prudent.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty of the play consist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>s, therefore, in understanding
the error of the protagonist, and in reconciling the character
of Zeus, as here depicted, with the theology elsewhere expressed
by &AElig;schylus. The most probable solution of the problem
is suggested by the ideal to which Greek tragedy aspired. It
was the object of the Athenian dramatists not to represent a simple
study of character, or to set forth a merely stirring action,
but to depict a hero worthy of all respect and admirable, exposed
to suffering or ruin by some fault of temperament. We are probably
meant to look upon Prometheus as having erred, though nobly,
through self-will, because he would not obey the ruler of the
world for the time being, nor abide the working-out of the law
of fate in patience, but tried to take that law into his own hands,
and to anticipate the evolution of events. At the same time the
play seems to convict supreme Zeus himself of a tyrannical exercise
of a forcefully acquired power: he also, through a like self-will,
appears to be kicking against the pricks of immutable destiny;
and it is prophesied that in his turn he will be superseded
by a more righteous ruler. The secret of the revolution in Olympus,
whereby Zeus will be deposed, is possessed by Prometheus,
and withheld by him from his tormentor. Thus the knowledge
of the future enables the hero of the drama to endure, while Zeus
upon his throne suffers through the consciousness that fate cannot
be resisted. Therefore the <i>Prometheus</i>, as we possess it, presents
the spectacle of two stubborn wills in conflict. The action
is suspended. The conclusion cannot be foreseen. Owing to its
very excellence as a work of art, it contains no indication of the
ultimate solution; we are only told by Prometheus that, after he
has been liberated, and not till then, he may reveal the means by
which the ruin of Zeus shall be averted. We are left to conjecture
that &AElig;schylus intended to harmonize the wills of the Titan
and his oppressor through the final submission of both alike to
the laws of destiny, which are supreme. Prometheus, when once
his pride has given way, will reveal the secret which he holds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> and
Zeus, made acquiescent by the lapse of time, will accept it.</p>

<p>The chief obstacle to the satisfactory interpretation of the
<i>Prometheus</i> springs, as I have hinted, from the difficulty of understanding
how Prometheus was guilty and Zeus justified. The
transgression of the hero, if it deserves the name at all, was eminently
noble. His punishment appears extravagant in its severity.
At first sight we can hardly avoid the conclusion that the
final alliance between the two conflicting actors in this drama was
a kind of political compromise, unworthy of the protagonist. To
this judgment Shelley was led by his hatred of despotism, and by
his inability to imagine a dignified termination to the dispute
that enlisted his sympathies so strongly on the side of the disinterested
hero. "I was averse," he says in the Preface to <i>Prometheus
Unbound</i>, "from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling
the Champion with the Oppressor of mankind. The moral
interest of the fable, which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings
and endurance of Prometheus, would be annihilated if we
could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing
before his successful and perfidious adversary." Those, however,
who have learned to respect the lofty theosophy of &AElig;schylus, no
less than to admire his imperial artistic faculty, will be slow to
accept the conclusion of Shelley, or to believe that the catastrophe
prepared by the Greek poet was feeble. They will rather
mistrust their powers of judgment, or suspect that the key to the
riddle has been lost. The truth is, that we have no means of settling
what the catastrophe really was; and at this point it is necessary
to give some account of the relation of this drama to the
entire scheme of &AElig;schylus.</p>

<p>The <i>Prometheus Bound</i> (&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#8061;&#964;&#951;&#962;) was probably the second of
a trilogy, or series of three tragedies, of which the first was called
<i>Prometheus the Fire-bearer</i> (&#960;&#965;&#961;&#966;&#8057;&#961;&#959;&#962;), and the third <i>Prometheus
Unbound</i> (&#955;&#965;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;). <i>Prometheus the Fire-bearer</i> and <i>Prome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>theus
Unbound</i> have disappeared; it seems that they were not
even known to the Greek scholiast, for he does not mention them
in his argument to the <i>Prometheus Bound</i>. At the same time
the argument prefixed to the <i>Pers&aelig;</i> informs us that that play was
the second in a series, of which the <i>Phineus</i> was first, the <i>Glaucus
Potnieus</i> third, and a so-called <i>Prometheus</i> fourth. It has
been conjectured that the <i>Prometheus</i> which formed the fourth
or satyric drama in this tetralogy was distinguished by the title
<i>Fire-kindler</i> (&#960;&#965;&#961;&#954;&#945;&#949;&#8059;&#962;,), a name which is mentioned in an obscure
passage of Pollux; and that consequently four plays altogether
by &AElig;schylus bore the title of <i>Prometheus</i>. It cannot,
however, be proved beyond doubt that the <i>Fire-kindler</i> existed
independent of the <i>Fire-bearer</i>; or, if so, that the former was the
last play in the tetralogy of the <i>Pers&aelig;</i>, the latter the first in the
trilogy of the <i>Prometheus Bound</i>. Both arguments to the only
<i>Prometheus</i> we possess entire are unfortunately silent about the
plays which accompanied it; and it is only from allusions to a
lost tragedy called <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> that we are at all justified
in assuming the disappearance of the first drama of the series,
and in calling it the <i>Fire-bearer</i>. It should be added that
the learned editor of the Greek Scenic Poets is inclined to identify
the <i>Fire-bearer</i> and the <i>Fire-kindler</i>, and to regard this play
as the satyric drama attached to the tetralogy of the <i>Pers&aelig;</i>. By
so doing he leaves the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> and <i>Unbound</i> without
a proper dramatic introduction.</p>

<p>In spite of the uncertainty which surrounds the criticism of
this play, no students familiar with the style of &AElig;schylus will
fail to recognize in the <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> the second drama
of a trilogy. It has the stationary character which belongs to
the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>, the <i>Pers&aelig;</i>, and the <i>Supplices</i>. The dramatic action
is not helped forward in these second pieces; they develop
the situation to which affairs have been brought by the events of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
a previous drama, and which in its turn must lead to the conclusive
action of the third piece. It was only in this way that a series
of three dramas on the same subject could be connected into
true artistic unity. The catastrophe of the first play produced a
combination of events which required such expansion in a second
that a new action, involving a final catastrophe, should be unfolded
in the third, and the whole series should in the end be
seen to have coherence. Now the <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> is unintelligible,
except as the result of a preceding action, while its conclusion
leaves the fate of the hero still undetermined: the events
which brought the hero to his dreadful doom, and the events
which will deliver him, are alluded to as things of the past and
of the future; in the present there is no drama, no doing, but
only a development of the intermediate and transitional situation.
We have, therefore, the right to assume the antecedence of a play
which must, according to the data given in our extant tragedy,
have turned upon the hero's theft of fire.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>We may now attempt to reconstruct the whole trilogy, and see
if, having done so, any new conditions are supplied for the solution
of the difficulty as originally stated. In the <i>Fire-bearer</i>, for
the subject-matter of which we have to rely on the allusions of
the <i>Bound</i>, Zeus has recently acquired the empire of the universe
by imprisoning his father, Kronos, and by defeating the giants
who rose up in arms against him. Prometheus, knowing, through
the inspiration of his mother, Earth, or Themis, that Zeus will prevail,
has taken his side, and has materially helped him in the conflict.
But the sympathies of Prometheus are less with Zeus than
with the race of men, who, at that primitive period of the world's
history, existed in the lowest state of wretchedness. Zeus, intent
on getting his new kingdom into order, entertains the notion of
destroying mankind, and planting a better stock of mortal beings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>on the earth. Prometheus opposes this design, and enables men
to raise themselves above their savage condition into comparative
power and comfort. It is just at this point that the lost drama
would probably have revealed the true nature of his offence, or
&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8055;&#945;. In the Hesiodic legend he is punished for having taught
men to deceive the powers of heaven; and though it is clear that
&AElig;schylus did not closely follow that version of the myth, we may
conjecture that he represented the benefactor of humanity as a
rebel against the ruler of Olympus. Against the express command
of Zeus, Prometheus gave men fire; and though this act
seems innocent enough, we must remember that, according to
Genesis, Adam lost Eden by merely plucking an apple. Satisfied
with his own sense of justice, and hardened in his pride by the
foreknowledge of the future, Prometheus resisted a power that he
regarded as tyrannical, and had to be treated by Zeus with the
same severity as Atlas or Typhoeus.</p>

<p>In the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> we see the beginning of his punishment.
The Titan, in whose person, as it were, the whole race of
mortals suffer, is crucified on a barren cliff of Scythia. Meanwhile
he makes two prophecies&mdash;first, that a descendant of Io is
destined to deliver him; and, secondly, that Zeus will marry and
beget a son who shall sway the universe in his place. At the
same time he declares that he knows how Zeus may avoid this
danger. Zeus, anxious to possess this secret, sends down Hermes,
and endeavors to wrest it from his prisoner with threats; but
Prometheus abides, scornful and unyielding; his pain may be increased,
yet it cannot last forever; he is immortal, and Zeus will
in the end be humiliated. To requite his contumacy, Zeus rends
the mountains, hell is opened, and Prometheus descends to the
lowest pit of Tartarus.</p>

<p>It is clear that, whate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>ver may have been the fault of Prometheus
in the <i>Fire-bearer</i>, the poet has done all in his power to excite
our sympathy for him in the second drama of the trilogy.
He draws the character of Oceanus as a trimmer and time-server,
who inspires contempt. He introduces Io suffering as a wretched
victim of the selfish love of her almighty master. He makes the
Oceanides willing in the end to share the doom of the Titan;
while all the human sympathies of the audience are powerfully
affected by the spectacle of a martyrdom incurred for their sake.
This play is, therefore, the triumph of the protagonist; his offence
is hidden; his heroic resistance is idealized; we are made
to feel sure that, when at last he is reconciled with Zeus, it will
be through no unworthy weakness on his part.</p>

<p>In the third drama of the trilogy, parts of which, translated
into Latin by Cicero, have been preserved to us, Prometheus has
been raised from Tartarus, and is again crucified on Caucasus.
A vulture sent by Zeus daily gnaws his liver, which, daily growing,
supplies continually fresh food for the tormentor. The tension
of the situation is still protracted. Prometheus has not given
way. Zeus has not relented. Meanwhile the seasons have revolved
through thirteen generations of the race of men, and the
deliverer appears. It is Herakles who cuts the Gordian knot. He
destroys the vulture, and persuades his father Zeus to suffer Cheiron,
the Centaur, whom he had smitten with a poisoned arrow,
and who is weary of continued life, to take the place of the Titan
in Hades. Then Prometheus is liberated. He declares that Zeus,
if he would avoid the coming doom, must refrain from marriage
with Thetis. He binds the willow of repentance round his forehead,
and places the iron ring of necessity upon his finger. His
will is made at last concordant with that of his enemy. Thetis
is given in wedlock to the mortal Peleus, and Achilles is born.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>From this last drama of the trilogy it would appear that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>honors of the whole series were reserved for Herakles. Herakles
is the offspring of Zeus by a mortal woman. He occupies, therefore,
a middle place between the two contending parties, and is
able to effect their reconciliation. We may fairly conclude that
herein lay the solution designed by &AElig;schylus. In order to mediate
between Zeus and Prometheus, a third agency was imperatively
demanded. The heroic demi-god, who is the son of the
Olympian, and at the same time a scion of oppressed humanity,
prompted by no decree of his father, but following the instincts
of his generous humanity, will not allow the torments of Prometheus
to continue. By killing the vulture, he resolves the justice
of Zeus in an act of mercy; at the same time, he touches the
heart of the Titan, and draws his secret from him, working a revolution
in the stubborn nature of Prometheus similar to that
which Neoptolemus effected in Philoctetes by his humane uprightness.
It is thoroughly in accordance with the spirit of Greek
tragedy that the scales should thus have fallen from the eyes of
Prometheus. He saw at last that Zeus, though severe, was really
justified; and, as a makepeace-offering, he rendered up the secret
which brought the ruler into harmony with the immutable laws
of fate. According to this solution of the plot, the final concession
of Prometheus would have been as noble as his intermediate
resistance; the &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#8051;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#945;, or revolution, which was imperatively
required before the drama could have been conducted to an issue,
would have taken place within the protagonist's soul, while Herakles,
by introducing a new element into the action, furnished the
efficient cause of its conclusion. It may be argued on the other
hand that Prometheus foreknew the advent of Herakles, and
prophesied of him to Io in the second drama of the trilogy. To
this I should answer that he could not then have calculated on
the change which would be wrought in his own character by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>deliverer.</p>

<p>How &AElig;schylus handled the subject-matter of the <i>Prometheus
Unbound</i> we cannot say. It seems, however, certain that, unless
he falsified his otherwise consistent conception of Zeus, as the
just and wise, though stern, lord of the universe, and unless he
satisfied himself with a catastrophe which Shelley would have
been justified in calling "feeble," he must, through Herakles, have
introduced a factor capable of solving the problem, by revealing
to Prometheus the nature of his original &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8055;&#945;, and thus rendering
it dignified for him to bow to Zeus.</p>

<p>If this reading of the <i>Prometheus</i> be accepted, it will be seen
that the whole trilogy involved the deepest interests, the mightiest
collision of wills, the most pathetic situations, and the most
sublime of reconciliations. Zeus, in the second drama of the series,
is purposely exposed to misrepresentation in order that his
true character in the climax, as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#946;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#8001;&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;, &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#8049;&#952;&#951; &#956;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#962;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">&#952;&#8051;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#8055;&#969;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>may be established. The divine justice personified in Zeus is displayed
irreconcilably opposed to the natural will personified in
Prometheus, until the hero who partakes of both, the active and
unselfish Herakles, atones them. We are even justified in conjecturing
that, as Prometheus occupied the foreground of the second
drama, so Zeus must have been paramount in the first, and that
the two antithetical propositions having thus been stated, the
chief part of the third play was assigned to Herakles. What
strengthens the interpretation now advanced is the peculiar nature
of the punishment of Prometheus. The liver, according to
antique psychology, was the seat of the passions; consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>Prometheus suffered through the organ of his sin.</p>

<p>That &AElig;schylus intended to describe the protagonist of his
trilogy as a transgressor, though offending in a noble cause, while
Zeus was acting in accordance with real justice, however hard to
comprehend, is further indicated by the series of events which are
supposed to have taken place between the termination of the <i>Fire-bearer</i>
and the climax of the <i>Unbound</i>. All this while Prometheus
in his obstinacy is suffering on Caucasus and in the depth
of Tartarus; but the way of salvation is meantime being wrought
out on earth. By the commerce of the Olympian deities with
the daughters of men the heroic race is generated; and not only
is the deliverer and reconciler, Herakles, sent forth to purge the
world of monstrous wrong, but the better age of equity and justice,
foreseen by the Titan and ordained by the Fates, is being
prepared. The marriage of Thetis to Peleus is the proper inauguration
of the heroic age; it not only confirms Zeus in his
sovereignty, but it also provides for humanity the greatest actor
in the drama of the Trojan war&mdash;the first historical event of
Hellas.</p>

<p>If the character ascribed to Zeus in the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> still
seems to offer difficulties; if, in other words, we are not satisfied
with assuming that his conduct must have been justified by the
evolution of events in the <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>, the following
considerations may be adduced by way of further explanation.
In the first place, at the supposed time of the <i>Prometheus Bound</i>,
Zeus was but just seated on his throne, and had to deal with unruly
and insurgent powers. The punishment of Prometheus was
an episode in the Titanomachy. It was the business, therefore,
of &AElig;schylus to exhibit the firmness and force of government of
the new ruler, not to draw the picture of a kind paternal monarch.
In the second place, the speakers who describe Zeus as
despotic belonged by kinship to the old order of the Titans, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>or
were closely related through friendship to Prometheus. Dramatic
propriety required that they should calumniate the new king,
or at least misunderstand his motives. In the third place, Io,
whose fate appeared so hard, became the mother of a mighty nation,
and received tenfold for all her sufferings at the hand of
Zeus.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Here, therefore, his inscrutable ways were in the end
proved righteous; nor is it probable that if &AElig;schylus justified
Zeus in his dealings with the unoffending Io, he would leave his
treatment of Prometheus unexplained. In the fourth place, the
theology of the Greeks was not absolute, like that to which we
are accustomed through Christianity. The power ascribed to
their deities was political and economical. Fate and necessity
determined the action of even Zeus, who was himself an outgrowth
from an earlier and ruder order. They also imagined a
gradual development in the moral order of the universe. The intellectual
powers of Olympus had superseded the old nature-forces
of the Titanic cosmogony. There was, therefore, nothing ridiculous
to the Greek mind in the notion that Zeus might be conceived
as growing in wisdom and in righteousness. In the fifth
place, we must remember that the Athenian audience, familiar
with the Hesiodic legend of Prometheus, were better prepared
than we are, after listening to the invectives against Zeus in the
second drama of the trilogy, to accept his triumphant justification
in the third.</p>

<p>Not only is the trilogy of &AElig;schylus&mdash;if, indeed, he composed a
Promethean trilogy at all&mdash;now irrecoverable except by hazardous
conjecture, but, what is more unfortunate, the whole mythus on
which it was based has descended to us in hopelessly mutilated
fragments. We can clearly perceive that it enshrined the deepest
speculations of the Greeks concerning the origin of humanity, the
relation of deified intelligence to material nature and to abstract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>necessity, the kinship between the human soul and the divine
spirit, and the consciousness of sin, which implies a division between
the will and the reason. Furthermore, there are hints implied
in it of purification through punishment, of ultimate reconciliation,
and of vicarious suffering. But the fabric of the legend
is so ruined that to reconstruct these elements of a theological
morality is now impossible. Moreover, the very conditions under
which the mythus flourished tended to divert the minds of the
Greeks themselves away from the underlying meaning to the romantic
presentation. The story could not fail to usurp upon the
doctrine. Like the Glaucus of Greek mythology, whom Plato
used as a parable in the <i>Republic</i>, the idea which takes shape in
a legend during the first ages of human speculation gathers an
accretion of the sea-weeds and the shells of fancy round it, lying
at the bottom of the ocean of the human mind through centuries,
so that, when it emerges into the light of critical inquiry, the original
lineaments of the conception are deformed and overgrown,
and to strip it bare and see it clearly is no easy matter. Far
more difficult is the task when only the maimed fragments, the
<i>disjecta membra</i>, of the myth remain to us.</p>

<p>However freely &AElig;schylus may have dealt with the tale of Prometheus,
however he may have employed it as a vehicle for rational
theology, he cannot have wholly eliminated those qualities
which belonged to it as a Saga rather than a chapter of religious
tradition. Indeed, by dramatizing, he was probably impelled to
accentuate the legendary outline at the expense of philosophical
coherence. This consideration may explain some of the apparent
incongruities in his fable, to which attention has not been yet directed
in this essay. One of these concerns the position of the
human race between Zeus, their apparent oppressor, and Prometheus,
their avowed champion. It was for the sake of mankind
that Prometheus disobeyed Zeus; it was through severity towa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>rds
mankind that Zeus placed himself at variance with justice. Yet
we find Zeus seeking a mortal bride among the daughters of the
men he had sought to destroy; nor is there any reason why, when
he could crucify their champion, he should not have annihilated
the whole race outright. Perhaps, however, we ought to conjecture
that, at this point, the episode of Deucalion and his restoration
of mankind after the deluge was understood to have intervened.</p>

<p>Other discrepancies may be stated briefly. In the elder version
of the fable presented by Hesiod, Prometheus is almost identified
with humanity, while some later fragments of the legend make
him the father of Deucalion. In &AElig;schylus he is an immortal
god, whose sympathy with men proceeds from generosity and
pity. Hesiod describes him as the son of the Titan Iapetos by
Asia. &AElig;schylus places him in the first rank of Titanic agencies,
by making him the son of Earth or Themis; he is married to
Hesione, daughter of Oceanus. Hesiod names his brother Epimetheus;
and herein we trace the remnants of an antique psychological
analysis, whereof &AElig;schylus has made no use. It is clear,
therefore, that the Attic poet dealt freely with the mythus, selecting
for artistic purposes only such points in the Hellenic fable as
would fit the framework of his drama.</p>

<p>The only sure ground, amid so much that is both shifting and
uncertain, is that the race of men had sinned against God, and
that Prometheus was a responsible co-agent in their crime. This
in itself is a strong argument in favor of the view which has been
urged throughout this essay. This view may be resumed in the
following positions. First, it is probable that the <i>Prometheus
Bound</i> is only the second drama of a trilogy. Secondly, the vilification
of Zeus as a despot must be understood in a dramatic
sense; it was appropriate to the situation of the actors, and intended
to enhance the pathos of the protagonist's suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>.
Thirdly, if we possessed the trilogy entire, we should see that
Prometheus had been really and gravely in the wrong, and that
his obstinacy was in the highest sense tragic according to the
Greek conception, inasmuch as it displayed the aberration of a
sublime character. Fourthly, the occasion of a worthy reconciliation
between Zeus and Prometheus, wherein the former should
forego his anger and the latter bend the proud neck of his will,
was furnished by Herakles, who held an intermediate position between
God and man, and who was recognized as the redresser of
wrongs and savior by the Greeks at large.</p>

<p>The trilogy of the <i>Oresteia</i> is at the same time the masterpiece
of &AElig;schylus as a dramatic poet, and also the surest source that
we possess for forming a theory of his theological opinions. I
do not propose to consider it from the second of these points of
view, but rather to concentrate attention upon its greatness as a
connected poem in three stupendous parts&mdash;as "the majestic image
of a high and stately tragedy shutting up and intermingling
her solemn scenes and acts with a sevenfold chorus of hallelujahs
and harping symphonies." In the <i>Oresteia</i> &AElig;schylus has plucked
the last fruit upon the Upas-tree of crime which flourished in the
palace of Mycen&aelig;. The murder of Agamemnon, after his return
in pomp and power from Troy, forms the subject of the first play.
By selecting this point for the overture to the series, the poet was
able to allude in choric songs to the ancestral curse of the house,
and also to the special crimes of Agamemnon, in his sacrifice of
Iphigeneia, in the protracted sufferings of the Argives before
Troy, and in his fatal pride. The vaticinations of Cassandra
opened a terrific vista of the horrors accumulated upon the family
of Thyestes. Thus the past was connected with the present,
and the intolerable account of guilt which Orestes, the chief actor,
was destined in the end, by the help of Heaven, to discharge, was
vividly presented to the minds of the audience. Agamemnon is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
murdered, and the tragedy closes with Clytemnestra's p&aelig;an of triumph
and defiance. She glories in her act, pretending that she
has duly revenged the death of Iphigeneia, and suppressing her
own adultery with &AElig;gisthus&mdash;a criminal motive more than enough
to vitiate its character of retributive justice.</p>

<p>The Chorus, who are hostile to her and her paramour, call upon
her, if she really slew her husband for Iphigeneia's sake, to leave
the palace and seek purification. This was her duty according to
Greek etiquette. But she refuses; and no Furies haunt her for
her crime, seeing that the Furies take account of none but kindred
blood, and Clytemnestra killed a man who was no relative
by birth, but only by marriage. Such is the strange doctrine
which the Eumenides themselves, in the third play of the series,
propound before the judgment-seat of Pallas. In a deeper sense
it was artistically fitting that Clytemnestra should remain unvisited
by the dread goddesses. They were the deities of remorse,
and she had steeled her soul against the stings of conscience.
Neither from the blood of a slain husband could they rise; nor
was there in her own heart harborage for their grim choir. But
though Clytemnestra escaped the spiritual visitings of the Erinnyes,
she knew what fear was. Orestes, as the Chorus told her,
was still living.</p>

<p>The <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i> continues the tale of blood and vengeance.
Orestes returns to Mycen&aelig;. He recognizes his sister Electra by
their father's tomb, deludes Clytemnestra with a false tale of his
own death, and then succeeds in killing her together with &AElig;gisthus
on the spot where they had murdered Agamemnon. Once
more the palace is thrown open; instead of Agamemnon and
Cassandra, Clytemnestra and &AElig;gisthus lie prostrate before the
desecrated altars, and Orestes exhibits to the Argives the robe in
which his father had been caught and tangled ere the axe descended
on his head. Then, when the song of joy is rising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
Electra and the Chorus, while they are crying that the ancient
Fury of the house has been appeased, at that very moment the
eyes of Orestes dilate with horror, his hair bristles, and he trembles
with madness. He sees what none around him may discern.
The Erinnyes of his mother are upon him, and he flies.
Like all the middle plays of a trilogy, the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i> is somewhat
stationary in its action. But this closing scene is tremendous.
It powerfully affected the imagination of the Greeks, and
continued, through the period of Gr&aelig;co-Roman art, to form a favorite
subject for sepulchral bass-reliefs. Some of these have
been preserved to us, the finest being one in the Capitoline Museum.</p>

<p>By the termination of the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i> we are prepared for yet
another tragedy, the last of the series. The <i>Eumenides</i> opens
with a scene which represents the Temple of Ph&#339;bus at Delphi.
Orestes has taken refuge with the god who bade him slay his
mother, and who must now purify him. He lies breathless at
the altar-steps with the branch of suppliant woollen-woven olive
in his hand. Not far away are stretched the Furies, hideous, and
snorting in their slumber. Ph&#339;bus, while they yet sleep, bids his
client rise and speed to Athens, to await the verdict of Pallas in
his case. So much we learn, partly from the speech of the Pythia,
and partly from the lips of the god himself. Then, when Orestes
has started on his way, the phantom of Clytemnestra appears and
bids the sleeping Furies rise. One by one they start, and groan
like hounds disturbed in the midst of dreamings of the chase.
When they see their prey has escaped, they break into full cry&mdash;a
brazen-throated chorus, accompanied by brazen-footed tramplings.
Ph&#339;bus, however, drives them forth with scorn from his
sun-bright shrine. Why linger they in those hyp&aelig;thral temple-chambers,
resonant with song and gladdened by the feet of youths
and maidens bearing bays? Their haunts should rather b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>e the
charnel-house, the shambles, the gallows, the torture-chamber of
barbarians. The scene is now changed to Athens, where Pallas
presides over the court of the Areiopagus assembled to decide between
the Furies who prosecute Orestes and Ph&#339;bus who defends
his suppliant. There is no doubt about the deed: Clytemnestra
was slain by her own son. The question to settle is, whether circumstance
could justify so unnatural an act. The Furies represent
the blind instinct of repulsion for the shedding of maternal
blood, which no <i>prima facie</i> argument can excuse, and which cannot
be covered. Ph&#339;bus is the holy and pure power, who will
not suffer moral abominations, like the unpunished insolence of
the murderess Clytemnestra, to abide. Pallas stands for reason,
capable of weighing motives, of disengaging a necessary act of
retributive justice from brute murder. In the breasts of the human
judges, these three faculties&mdash;the instinct which condemns
matricide, the instinct which sanctions under any circumstance
the punishment of crime, and the reason which holds the balance
of impulses&mdash;are active. After much angry pleading by the advocates
on both sides, the votes are taken. Half decide against
Orestes; half acquit him. Pallas, by her casting vote, determines
the verdict in his favor. The Eumenides, disappointed of their
prey, threaten vengeance against Athens; but Pallas appeases
them, and assigns them a place of honor in her city forever.</p>

<p>It is clear that the three plays of this trilogy are closely bound
together, and that their connection is that of thesis, antithesis, and
synthesis. The <i>Agamemnon</i> sets forth the crime of Clytemnestra;
the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i> exhibits the exceptional conduct of Orestes
with regard to that crime; the <i>Eumenides</i> contains his exculpation.
The third play offers a reconciliation of the agencies at
warfare in the first and second; the curse of the house of Atreus
is worked out and set at rest by the hero whose awful duty it was
to revenge a father's murder on a mother. His justification lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
in his submission to the divine will. Had he taken the matricidal
office on himself in haste or anger, he must have added another
link to the chain of crime that hitherto had bound his family
through generations. What he did, however, was done with a
clear conscience; and, though he suffered the maddening anguish
of so terrible an act, he found rest and peace for his soul at last.
Thus a new power, unrealized in the <i>Agamemnon</i> and the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>,
was needed for the solution presented in the <i>Eumenides</i>.</p>

<p>Passing from the internal structure of these dramas to their
form, we may notice how &AElig;schylus provided theatrical variety
consistent with the varying subject. It was requisite that the action
of the two first should take place at Mycen&aelig;; so the scene
was not altered, but the Chorus was changed, in order that the pathos
of Electra's situation might be made more clear in the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>.
The <i>Eumenides</i> admitted not only of a new Chorus, but
also of a total change of scene; it may be added that this third
drama violates the unities alike of place and time.</p>

<p>Of the three plays of the trilogy, the <i>Agamemnon</i> is unquestionably
the noblest. It is the masterpiece of &AElig;schylus, and to
one who has conquered its difficulties and imbibed its spirit it offers
a spectacle of tragic grandeur not to be surpassed, hardly to
be equalled, by anything which even Shakespeare produced. What
some modern critics might regard as defects&mdash;the lengthy choric
passages, abstract in their thought, though splendid in their imagery&mdash;the
concentration of the poet's powers on one terrific climax,
for every word that Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, and Cassandra
utter leads up to the death-cry of the king&mdash;contribute to
the excellence of a drama of this style. If we lack the variety
and subtlety that charm us in a work like <i>Hamlet</i>; if, after
reading the play over and over again, and testing it in many crucibles
of critical analysis, we do not, as in the case of Shakespeare's
tragedies, discover new and delicate beauties in the minor parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>,
but learn each time, and by each process, to admire the vigor of
the poet's main conception, the godlike energy with which he has
developed it; that may be taken as the strongest proof of its perfection
as a monument of classic art.</p>

<p>There is, in the <i>Agamemnon</i>, an oppressive sense of multitudinous
crimes, of sins gathering and swelling to produce a tempest.
The air we breathe is loaded with them. No escape is possible.
The marshalled thunder-clouds roll ever onward, nearer
and more near, and far more swiftly than the foot can flee. At
last the accumulated storm bursts in the murder of Agamemnon,
the majestic and unconscious victim felled like a steer at the stall;
in the murder of Cassandra, who foresees her fate, and goes to
meet it with the shrinking of some dumb creature, and with the
helplessness of one who knows that doom may not be shunned;
in the lightning-flash of Clytemnestra's arrogance, who hitherto
has been a glittering hypocrite, but now proclaims herself a fiend
incarnate. As the Chorus cries, the rain of blood, that hitherto
has fallen drop by drop, descends in torrents on the house of
Atreus: but the end is not yet. The whole tragedy becomes yet
more sinister when we regard it as the prelude to ensuing tragedies,
as the overture to fresh symphonies and similar catastrophes.
Wave after wave of passion gathers and breaks in these stupendous
scenes; the ninth wave mightier than all, with a crest whereof
the spray is blood, falls foaming; over the outspread surf of
gore and ruin the curtain drops, to rise upon the self-same theatre
of new woes.</p>

<p>The imagery of the <i>Agamemnon</i> most powerfully contributes
to heighten the tragic impression of the plot. At one time the
ancestral fury of the doomed house is likened to a demon leaping
on it from above, by a metaphor which vividly suggests Blake's
design of Satan pouring flame upon the dwelling of Job's sons.
At another it is compared to a cormorant brooding upon its bat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>tlements;
and yet again, by a stroke of irony peculiarly impressive
to the Greeks, it is likened to a band of revellers. The repetition
of the same class of metaphors, the frequent references to the net
in which Agamemnon was to be caught, to the axe with which
he and Cassandra were to be slaughtered, to the smoke and scent
of blood which was to bathe the altar of the household Zeus with
sacrifice unhallowed, assail the imagination with portentous monotony.</p>

<p>Of all the terrors in this tragedy none is so awful in itself, or
so artistically heightened, as Cassandra's prophecy. Accompanying
her lord and master, she has approached the palace of Mycen&aelig;.
Clytemnestra has greeted the king with a set oration, admirable
for its rhetoric, covering by dark innuendoes her foul
thought. Spreading upon the threshold purple raiment and mantles
suited to the service of the gods&mdash;such embroidered garments,
we may fancy, as Athenian ladies wrought for Pallas&mdash;she exclaims:
"Descend from this thy chariot; nor set on earth, dread
monarch, thy foot that trampled upon Troy." It is as though a
medi&aelig;val wife should bid her lord, returning from the East, to
tread on altar-cloths and sacerdotal vestments. Agamemnon
shrinks from the sacrilege, but she overrules his scruples, and he
complies. All this while Cassandra is seated, patient, in her car.
Like a statue sculptured in monumental alabaster, with hands upon
her knees, and head bowed on her breast, she waits unmoved.
Then the conqueror is led in to his doom&mdash;a doom which the
Chorus, in one of their wild eddying hymns of woe, seem almost
to anticipate. Still Cassandra tarries; and now Clytemnestra
comes again, with taunts and dreadful irony: "Happy are you,
princess though you be, to have such rich and prosperous masters;
enter the palace; the sacrifice is ready at the altar, and to
this, as a slave of the house, you, too, are bidden." But Cassandra
will not move. In her soul, where, though a slave, she still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
retains the gift of oracular vision, she foresees her doom. She
knows what the riches of the house of Atreus mean, what the
prosperity of Agamemnon really is, what the sacrifice to which
she, too, is bidden will be. Clytemnestra leaves her, half in scorn
and half in anger. Then, at length, Cassandra lifts her head, and
stirs herself, and groans. The first word she utters is "Apollo!
oh! Apollo!" This rouses the Chorus, and they ask: "What
cry of wailing hast thou shrieked about Apollo? He is not a
god to be greeted with dirges." Ph&#339;bus was, in truth, the deity
of brightness and music, not of the funeral groan or death lament.
Still Cassandra, with the same ill-omened utterance, reverberates
the name: "Apollo! ah, Apollo! lo, a second time hast thou undone
me!" To Ph&#339;bus she had promised her virginity; the
promise was not kept, and he requited her with prophecy that
none might heed or understand. No tragic portion is more piteous
than this of her who was the clear-eyed seer of coming woes,
the unwilling mouthpiece of dread oracles, doomed alike to knowledge
worse than ignorance, and to the scorn that falls on idle babblers.
Now, once again, descending on her with the might of
prophecy, the god compels her to predict her own swift-coming
fate. Little by little, at the intercession of the Chorus, Cassandra
becomes more articulate. She calls the house before her "the
shambles of a man, a pavement blood-bedabbled." There stands
the stately palace-front; its marble steps are covered with tapestry,
the statues of its protective gods are crowned with flowers;
while the lonely prophetess is shuddering at so fair a frontispiece
to a tragedy within so frightful, now to be accomplished on her
master and herself. Meantime the Chorus also wait, involved in
their own anxiety; the mysterious anguish of the weird woman,
whom they know to have the hand of God laid heavily upon her,
makes them tremble. "What mean you," they exclaim, "by
scenting like a dog for blood upon this royal threshold?" Cas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>sandra
only answers: "Are not these children wailing for their
death enough? Is not their flesh, tasted by their father at their
uncle's board, my witness?" She points to phantoms which the
Chorus cannot see, the ghosts of the children of Thyestes. They
reply sullenly, for they know the story of the house: "We want
no soothsayers." Then Cassandra breaks forth afresh, this time
vaticinating imminent calamity: "What is she plotting, what
doom unbearable? and there is none to aid!" The Chorus take
up their strain: "Here, indeed, you are a riddler; what you
meant before was common talk." But Cassandra heeds them
not. Her second-sight pierces the palace-walls, and she shrieks:
"Mad woman, are you decking your husband for the bath? The
end draws near. Hand stretches forth to hand. Is it a net of
hell? Keep the ox from the heifer! she hath caught him in her
robe and slays him. I tell you he is falling, falling in the trough
of death." The Chorus are puzzled by these hurried and ecstatic
exclamations; but their very fear seems to keep them from the
apprehension of the truth. Then Cassandra changes her tone,
and bewails her own misfortunes, her coming death, and the crime
of Paris which brought her to this doom, employing throughout
these prophecies a lyric metre suited to their pregnant brevity.
At last, when she has wellnigh worn out the patience of the
Chorus, she assumes the regular iambic of common speech:
"Now, then, at length shall the oracle gaze upon you free from
veils like a bride. The Furies are in this house; blood-surfeited,
but not assuaged, they hold perpetual revel here. It is the crime
of Atreus and of Thyestes which they hunt, and woe will fall on
woe." The Chorus can only wonder that she, a foreign princess,
should know the secrets of the fated race; but she tells them the
story of Apollo's love, and how she deceived him, and what he
wrought to punish her. Then, even as she speaks, the pang of
inspiration thrills her. Perhaps the speech that follows, thr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>ough
its ghastly blending of visions evoked from the past with insight
piercing into the immediate future, affects the imagination more
intensely than any other piece of tragic declamation. Even the
sleep-mutterings of Lady Macbeth, though they form a curious
modern counterpart to the broken exclamations of Cassandra, are
less appalling; for hers reveal a guilty conscience maddened by
one crime, while Cassandra's outcry sums up the history of a
whole accursed race, and expresses at the same time the agony
of an innocent victim:</p>

<p>No translation can do justice to the appalling fury of the original,
since it is only in Greek&mdash;a language usually sedate and harmonized
by sense of beauty&mdash;that such phrases as &#952;&#8059;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#7944;&#8147;&#948;&#959;&#965;
&#956;&#951;&#964;&#8051;&#961;' have their full value. The Chorus are shaken from their
incredulity, as much by the intensity of Cassandra's conviction as
by the desperate calm of her last words. Is Agamemnon really
to be slain? Yes, she answers, and, pray or not as you may
choose, they there inside the house are slaying. Then once more
the rage of divination seizes her, and the scene of her own death,
like that of Agamemnon's, flames upon her soul. The second
speech has more of pathos than the first, less of fury; but it is
scarcely less awful:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The draught of prophecy is now drained to the very dregs.
Nothing remains but for Cassandra to enter the palace-doors of
Hades. She approaches them step by step, bewailing, after the
fashion of Greek tragedy, her own woes, and those of Priam's
family. Suddenly she starts. The scent of blood assails her
nostrils, and, like a steer that shivers at the gory shambles, she
draws back. The Chorus say, "It is only the smell of sacrifice
upon the hearth." But the weird woman discovers a very different
odor of coming slaughter: "To me the reek is like the breath
of charnels." Still forward, though shrinking from the unseen,
unavoidable doom, she must advance, invoking the avenger of
herself and Agamemnon, and calling on the all-seeing sun. Her
last words are uttered in the same spirit as Macbeth's soliloquy
upon the point of battle; they intensify and elevate the tragic
moment by drawing the whole destiny of mortals into harmony
with her own doom:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, lives of men! When prosperous, they glitter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a fair picture; when misfortune comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wet sponge at one blow hath blurred the painting.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, at the last, tranquil and stately, she touches the door, enters,
and it shuts behind her. For a while the Chorus stand alone,
and sing a low, brief chant of terror. The scene is empty, and
the palace-front towers up into calm light. Then, when our nerves
have been strained to the cracking-point of expectation by Cassandra's
prophecy and by the silence that succeeds it, from within
the house is heard the deep-chested cry of Agamemnon: "O me,
I am stricken with a stroke of death!" This shriek is the most
terrible incident in all tragedy, owing to its absolute and awful
timeliness, its adequacy to the situation. The whole dramatic apparatus
of the play has been, as it were, constructed with a view
to it; yet, though we expect it, our heart stops when at last it
comes. The stillness, apparently of home repose, but really of
death, which broods upon the house during those last moments,
while every second brings the hero nearer to his fate, has in it a
concentrated awfulness that surpasses even the knocking at the
gate in <i>Macbeth</i>. Then comes the cry of Agamemnon, and the
whole structure of terror descends upon us. It is as though an
avalanche had been gathering above our heads and gradually
loosening&mdash;loosening with fearfully accelerated ratio of movement
as the minutes fly&mdash;until a single word will be enough to
make it crumble. That word, uttered from behind the stately
palace-walls, startling the guilty and oppressive silence, intimating
that the workers have done working, that the victim has been
taken in their toils, is nothing less than the shriek of the smitten
king. It sounds once for the death-blow given; and once again
it sounds to mark a second stroke. Then shriek and silence are
alike forgotten in the downfall of the mass of dread. The Cho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>rus
are torn asunder by hurried and conflicting counsels, eddying like
dead leaves caught and tossed in the clutches of a tempest. Horror
huddles upon horror, as the spectacle of slaughter is itself revealed&mdash;the
king's corpse smoking in the silver bath, Cassandra
motionless in death beside him. Above them stands Clytemnestra,
shouldering her murderous axe, with open nostrils and dilated
eyes, glorying in her deed, cherishing the blood-drops on her
arms and dress and sprinkled bosom; while, invisible to mortal
eyes, the blood-swilled demon of the house sits eying her as its
next victim. &AElig;gisthus&mdash;craven, but spiteful&mdash;slinks forth, hyena-like,
after the accomplished act, to trample on the hero and insult
his grave.</p>

<p>Some such spectacle as this was revealed to the Athenians by
the rolling back of the eccyclema at the end of the <i>Agamemnon</i>.
The triumph of adulterous Clytemnestra and cowardly &AElig;gisthus
would, however, have been far from tragic in its utter moral baseness,
did we not know that this drama was to be succeeded by another
which should right the balance. Perhaps this is the reason
why the <i>Oresteia</i> is the only extant trilogy. Its three parts are
so closely interlinked that to separate them was impossible. The
preservers of the <i>Agamemnon</i> were forced to preserve the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>;
the preservers of the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i> could not dispense with
the <i>Eumenides</i>.</p>

<p>The Chorus of the <i>Agamemnon</i> demands separate criticism.
The Chorus in all Greek tragedy performs, it has been often said,
the part of an ideal spectator. It comments on the plot, not daring
so much actively to interfere, as uttering reflections on the
conduct of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, and referring all obscure events
to the arbitrament of heaven. Thus the Chorus is a mirror of
the poet's mind, an index to the moral which he inculcates, an inspired
critic of each movement in the play. The choric odes, introduced
at turning-points in the main action, are lyrical inter-breathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>s
that connect the past and future with the present. In
the plays of &AElig;schylus the Chorus, as I have already shown, is,
moreover, personally interested in the drama. In the case of the
<i>Agamemnon</i> the fortunes of the burghers of Mycen&aelig; are engaged
in the success or failure of Clytemnestra's scheme. At the same
time, knowing the whole dark history of the house of Atreus,
they foresee the perils which their master, as a member of that
family, must run. It follows that their songs embody the moral
teaching of the tragedy itself without lapsing into mere sententiousness.
Their sympathies, antipathies, and interests add a vital
importance to their utterance. The burden of all these odes
is that punishment for crime, however long delayed or tortuous
in its operation, is inevitable. The grandeur of the whole work
depends in a great measure on the force with which this idea is
wrought out lyrically, sometimes by bold images, sometimes by
dark innuendoes, repeated like a mystic rede, or tossed upon the
eddies of a wizard chant. From beginning to ending these ancient
men are adverse to the sons of Atreus, gloomily conscious
that they cannot prosper. While recognizing the justice of their
cause against Paris, who had transgressed the laws of hospitable
Zeus, they yet remember Agamemnon's swiftness to shed his
daughter's blood, the old Erinnys which pursues the race, the
wholesale slaughter of Achaian citizens before Troy's walls.
These recollections inspire them with uneasiness before the Messenger
appears. Their doubts are confirmed by his news that the
altars of the Trojans had been dishonored, while their mistrust of
Clytemnestra adds yet a deeper hue to their alarm. Then comes
the scene with Cassandra. No more doubt remains; and the
only question is how to act. Even at the last moment the
Chorus do not lose their faith. They defy Clytemnestra, telling
her to her face that her crime must be avenged, that the curse
must be worked out to the full, and that justice cannot fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
triumph. At the very end they rise to prophecy: you, yourself,
unfriended in the end, shall fall; the doer, when Zeus wills, shall
suffer for his deed; remember, therefore, that Orestes lives.</p>

<p>The choric interludes of the <i>Agamemnon</i>, though burdened
with the mystery of sin and fate, and tuned to music stern and
lofty, abound in strains of pathetic and of tender poetry, deep-reaching
to the very fount of tears, unmatched by aught else in
the Greek language. The demiurge who gave a shape to Titans
and to Furies mingled tears with the clay of the men he wrought,
and star-fire with the beauty of his women, and even for the
birds of the air and the wild creatures of the woods he felt a
sympathy half human, half divine. In the first Chorus, &AElig;schylus
compares the Atreid&aelig; to eagles robbed of their young, whose
cries are answered by Zeus, Ph&#339;bus, or Pan. "Hearing the
shrill clamor of these airy citizens, he sendeth after-vengeance
on the robbers." And, again, Artemis exacts penalty for the
hare whom the eagles bore off to their nests, a prey. "So kindly
disposed is the fair goddess to the tender young of fierce lions,
and to the suckling brood of all beasts that range the field and
forest." Thus the large philosophy of the poet includes justice
for all living things, and even dumb creatures have their rights,
which men may not infringe.</p>

<p>The depth of his human pathos no mere plummet-line of
scholarship or criticism can fathom. Before the vision of Iphigeneia
at the altar we must needs be silent: "Letting fall her
saffron-colored skirts to earth, she smote each slayer with a piteous
arrow from her eyes, eloquent as in a picture, desiring speech,
since oftentimes beside the well-spread board within her father's
hall she sang, and maidenly, with chaste voice, honored the p&aelig;an
raised in happy times at festal sacrifice of her dear sire." We do
not need the sententious moral of Lucretius uttered four centuries
later, <i>tantum relligio potuit suadere malorum</i>, to point the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span> pathos
which &AElig;schylus, with a profounder instinct, draws by one touch
from the contrast between then and now. In the same strain is
the description of Menelaus abandoned in his home by Helen:
"She, leaving to her fellow-citizens the din of shielded hosts, and
armings of the fleet with spears, bringing to Ilion destruction for
a dower, went lightly through the doors, dishonorably brave; and
many a sigh was uttered by the bards of the palace, while they
sang&mdash;O house! O house, and rulers! O marriage-bed, and pressure
on the pillows of her head who loved her lord! He stands
by in silence, dishonored, but without reproaches, noting with anguish
of soul that she is fled. Yea, in his longing after her who
is beyond the sea, a phantom will seem to rule his house. The
grace of goodly statues hath grown irksome to his gaze, and in
his widowhood of weary eyes all beauty fades away. But dreams
that glide in sleep with sorrow visit him, conveying a vain joy;
for vain it is, when one hath seemed to see good things, and lo,
escaping through his hands, the vision flies apace on wings that
follow on the paths of sleep."</p>

<p>To read the Greek aright in this wonderful lyric, so concentrated
in its imagery, and so direct in its conveyance of the very
soul of passion, is no light task; but far more difficult it is to
render it into another language. Yet, even thus, we feel that
this poem of defrauded desire and everlasting farewell, of vain
outgoings of the spirit after vanished joy, is written not merely
for Menelaus and the Greeks, but for all who stretch forth empty
hands to clasp the dreams of dear ones, and then turn away, face-downward
on the pillow, from the dawn, to weep or strain hot
eyes that shed no tears. Touched by the same truth of feeling,
which includes all human nature in its sympathy, is the lament,
shortly after uttered by the Chorus, for the numberless fair men
who died before Troy town. Ares, the grim gold-exchanger, who
barters the bodies of men, sends home a little dust shut up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>in
a narrow urn, and wife and father water this with tears, and cry&mdash;Behold,
he perished nobly in a far land, fighting for a woman, for
another's wife. And others there are who come not even thus
again to their old home; but barrows on Troy plain enclose their
fair young flesh, and an alien soil is their sepulchre. This picture
of beautiful dead men, warriors and horsemen, in the prime of
manhood, lying stark and cold, with the dishonor of the grave
upon their comely hair, and with the bruises of the battle on limbs
made for love, is not meant merely for Achaians, but for all&mdash;for
us, perchance, whose dearest moulder on Crimean shores or
Indian plains, for whom the glorious faces shine no more; but at
best some tokens, locks of hair, or books, or letters, come to stay
our hunger unassuaged. How truly and how faithfully the Greek
poet sang for all ages, and for all manner of men, may be seen
by comparing the strophes of this Chorus with the last rhapsody
but one of the chants outpoured in America by Walt Whitman,
to commemorate the events of the great war. The pathos which
unites these poets, otherwise so different in aim and sentiment, is
deep as nature, real as life; but from this common root of feeling
springs in the one verse a spotless lily of pure Hellenic form,
in the other a mystical thick growth of fancy, where thoughts
brood and nestle amid tufted branches; for the powers of classic
and of modern singers upon the same substance of humanity are
diverse.</p>

<p>The <i>Pers&aelig;</i> is certainly one of the earliest among the extant
tragedies of &AElig;schylus, since it was produced upon the stage in
473 B.C., seven years after the battle of Salamis. This drama
can scarcely be called a tragedy in the common sense of the word.
It is rather a tragic show, designed to grace a national festival
and to preserve the memory of a great victory. That purpose it
fulfilled effectively; the events it celebrates were still recent; the
author of the play had fought himself at Salamis, and the whol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>e
Athenian people were glowing with the patriotic impulse that had
placed them first among the states of Hellas. &AElig;schylus was,
however, too deeply conscious of the spirit of his art to let the
<i>Pers&aelig;</i> sink into the rank of pageantry or triumph. The defeat
of Xerxes and his host supplied him with a splendid tragic instance
of pride humbled, and greatness brought to nothing,
through one man's impiety and pride. The moral that the poet
wished to draw is put into the mouth of Darius, whose ghost,
evoked by Atossa and the Chorus, completes the tale of Persian
disasters by predicting the battle of Plat&aelig;a. "Swiftly are the
oracles accomplished. I looked for length of days; but when a
man hastes, God helps to urge him on. It was my son's insolence,
in chaining the holy Hellespont, and thinking he could stay
the Bosporus, the stream divine, from flowing, which brought
these woes. He thought to make a path for his army, to hold
Poseidon and the powers of Heaven in bondage&mdash;he a mortal, and
they gods! Few of his great host shall come again to Susa. In
Hellas they must pay the penalty of arrogance and godless hearts.
Coming to that land, they thought it no shame to rob the statues
of the gods and burn the shrines; the altars were cast down, the
temples overthrown. Therefore, as they did evil, evil shall they
suffer. Heaps of dead upon Plat&aelig;a's plain shall tell to the third
generation, by speechless signs appealing to the eyes of men, that
no man mortal may dare raise his heart too high. For insolence
blooms forth and bears the crop of disaster, whence one reaps a
harvest of tears. Seeing which payment for these crimes, remember
Hellas and Athens. Nor let a man, in scorn of his own lot,
desire another's good, and spill much wealth; for Zeus, in sooth,
stands high above, a grievous schoolmaster, to tame excessive lifting-up
of hearts." Nowhere else, it may be said, has &AElig;schylus
thought fit so decidedly to moralize his dramatic motive, or so
clearly to state in simple words his philosophy of Nem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>esis. The
ghost of Darius, as may be conjectured from this address, does
not belong to the same race as the Banquos and Hamlets of our
stage. He is a political phantom, a monarch evoked from his
mausoleum to give sage counsel, and well-informed about the affairs
of his empire.</p>

<p>By laying the scene of this drama at Susa, the ancient capital
of the Persian kings, &AElig;schylus was enabled to adopt a style of
treatment peculiarly flattering to his Greek audience. The Persians
are made to bewail their own misfortunes, to betray the rottenness
of their vast empire, and to lament the wretchedness of
nations subject to the caprice of irresponsible and selfish princes.
Inured to slavery, they hug their chains; and, though in rags,
Xerxes is still to them a demi-god. The servility of Oriental
courtiers, the pomp and pride of Oriental princes, the obsequious
ceremonies and the inflated flatteries of barbarians, are translated
for Greek ears and eyes into gorgeous forms by the poet, whose
own genius had something Asiatic in its tone and temper. Many
occasions for grim irony are afforded by this mode of handling,
whereof the famous speech of Atossa on the clothes of Xerxes, if
that, indeed, be genuine, and the inability of the Chorus, through
servile shyness, to address the ghost of Darius, furnish the most
obvious examples. A finer and subtler note is struck in the dialogue
between Atossa and the Chorus just before the news of the
defeat at Salamis arrives. She asks where Athens may be found:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#945; &#948;' &#7952;&#954;&#956;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#952;&#8051;&#955;&#969;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8038; &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#953;, &#960;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#7944;&#952;&#8053;&#957;&#945;&#962; &#966;&#945;&#963;&#8054;&#957; &#7985;&#948;&#961;&#8166;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#967;&#952;&#959;&#957;&#8057;&#962;&#894;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This offers the poet an opportunity for putting into the mouth
of the Persian coryph&aelig;us a flattering account of his own nation:
No monarch have they, few are they, but all men of might, and
strong enough to rout the myriad bowmen of the Persian host
with spear and shield. The <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of the description&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>in itself
highly complimentary to the Athenians&mdash;must have made it effective
on the stage. We may fancy how the cheering of the
men of Marathon re-echoed from the Dionysian theatre, and filled
Athene's hill "song-wise" with sound, as each triumphant trochaic
leaped forth from the Persian lips. At the same time the tragic
irony is terrible, for the queen is on the point of hearing from
the Messenger that this mere handful of spearmen crushed her
son's host, countless as the stars, in one day upon sea and shore.
The real point of that fierce duel of two nations, which decided
the future of the human race&mdash;the contrast between barbarians
and men in whom the spirit was alive, between slaves driven to
the fight like sheep and freemen acting consciously as their own
will determined, between the brute force of multitudes and the inspired
courage of a few heroes&mdash;has never been expressed more
radiantly than in this play. No language of criticism can do justice
to the incomparable brilliancy and vigor with which the tale
of Salamis is told. We must remember, in reading the speeches
of the Messenger, that this is absolutely the first page of Greek
history. It came before Herodotus, and the soldier-poet, who had
seen what he narrated, was no less conscious than we are, after all
our study, of the real issues, of the momentous interests at stake.
Never elsewhere has contemporary history been written thus. In
these triumphant rheseis &AElig;schylus did not choose to maintain a
bare dramatic propriety. The herald is relating disaster after disaster;
yet the elation of the poet pulses through his speech, and
he cannot be sad. We feel that, while he is dinning into the ears
of the barbarian empress and her courtiers this panegyric of Hellenic
heroism, he is really speaking to an Attic audience. The
situation is, however, sufficiently sustained for theatrical purposes
by the dignity wherewith Atossa meets her ruin. She shows herself
a queen in spite of all, and the front she presents to "the sea
of troubles" (&#954;&#945;&#954;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#8051;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#962;) breaking over the whole Asian em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>pire
is fully adequate to the magnitude of the calamity. It is
difficult to believe that the speech written for her by &AElig;schylus,
when she returns with the libations for Darius, was not intended,
by its grandly decorative style, to convey the impression of calmness
in the midst of sorrow. Atossa is great enough to be self-possessed,
and to dwell with tender thoughtfulness upon the gifts
of nature beloved by the powers of darkness. The lines are
these:</p>

<p>This passage is a fair example of the "mighty line" of &AElig;schylus,
employed for purposes of pure adornment. The pomp and
circumstance of tragic style, which he so well knew how to use,
gave unrivalled dignity to his narration. Yet this style, even in
the days of Aristophanes, had come to sound extravagant, while
its occasional bombast, as in the famous periphrasis for dust,</p>

<p>very cleverly parody the effect of the more tumid passages. Yet
when &AElig;schylus chose to be simple he combined majesty with
grace, strength with beauty, and speed with volume, in a style
which soars higher and reaches farther than the polished perfection
of Sophocles or the artistic elegance of Euripides. The descriptions
of Ionia and Doria drawing Xerxes' chariot in Atossa's
dream, and of the education of mankind in the <i>Prometheus</i>, belong
to his more pure and chastened manner. The famous speech
in which Clytemnestra tells of the leaping up of watchfire after
watchfire from Troy to Mycen&aelig;, of Ida flashing the flame to the
Herm&aelig;an cliff of Lemnos, of Athos taking it up and sending it
with joy across the gulf to far Makistus, of the Messapian warders
lighting their dry heath and speeding the herald-blaze in brightness
like the moon to Cith&aelig;ron, and thence, by peak and promontory,
over fen and plain and flickering armlet of the sea, onward
to Agamemnon's palace-tower&mdash;this brilliant picture, glittering
with the rarest jewels of imaginative insight, can only be coupled
with the Salaminian speeches of the <i>Pers&aelig;</i>. They stand in a
place apart. Purity, lucidity, rapidity, energy, elevation, and fiery
intensity of style are here divinely mingled. There is no language
and no metre equal to the Greek and the iambic for such
resonant, elastic, leaping periods as these. The firm grasp upon
reality preserved by &AElig;schylus, even in his most passionate and
most imaginative moments, adds force unrivalled to these descriptive
passages.</p>

<p>At the same time he surpassed all the poets of his nation in a
certain Shakespearian concentration of phrase. The invectives uttered
by Cassandra against Clytemnestra, and her broken exclamations,
abound in examples of energetic, almost grotesque, imagery,
not to be paralleled in Greek literature. The whole of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>e <i>Seven
against Thebes</i>, and in particular that choric ode which describes
the capture and sack of a town, might be cited with a similar intention.
But perhaps the strongest instance of this more than
Greek vehemence of expression is the denunciation hurled by
Ph&#339;bus at the Furies in his Delphian shrine:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away, I bid you! Leave my palace halls:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quit these pure shrines oracular with speed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest haply some winged glistening serpent sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the gold-twisted bow-wire bite your flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye, pain-stricken, vomit gory froth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clotted spilth of man's blood ye have supped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, these gates are not yours! <i>There</i> is your dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where heads are chopped, eyes gouged in savage justice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throats cut, and bloom of boys unnamably<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is mangled; there where nose and ears are slithered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stonings, and the piteous smothered moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of slaves impaled. Hence! Hear ye not whereby,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loving like ghouls these banquets, ye're become<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gods abominable? Lo, your shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bewrays your spirit. Blood-swilled lions' dens<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Go, heifers grazing without herdsman, go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To herd like yours no face of god is kindly.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another Shakespearian quality in the &AElig;schylean use of language
and of imagery might be illustrated from his metaphors.
He calls the ocean a forest&mdash;&#960;&#8057;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#963;&#959;&#962; or &#7937;&#955;&#8055;&#961;&#961;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#963;&#959;&#962;&mdash;as
though he would remind us of the great sea-beasts that roam like
wolves or lions down beneath the waves. The vultures are &#8000;&#958;&#8059;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#953;
&#918;&#951;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#954;&#8059;&#957;&#949;&#962;. The eagle is &#916;&#953;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#964;&#951;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#954;&#8059;&#969;&#957; &#948;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8057;&#962;.
The Furies of Clytemnestra are &#956;&#951;&#964;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7956;&#947;&#954;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#954;&#8059;&#957;&#949;&#962;. The
Argives who poured forth from the Wooden Horse to plunder
Troy are called &#7944;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#8049;&#954;&#959;&#962;, &#7989;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#965; &#957;&#949;&#959;&#963;&#963;&#8057;&#962;, &#7936;&#963;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#951;&#966;&#8057;&#961;&#959;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>&#962; &#955;&#949;&#8061;&#962;.
The flame of the thunderbolt becomes &#960;&#965;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#956;&#966;&#8053;&#954;&#951;&#962; &#946;&#8057;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#962;.

&#960;&#8061;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#945;. In all these metaphors we trace an imaginative energy
which the Greek poets usually sought to curb. When we speak
of the mighty line of &AElig;schylus, we naturally remember verses like
these:</p>

<p>which carry with them a massive weight, not only of sound and
words, but also of meaning and of imagery. No wonder that
Aristophanes jestingly compared the gravity of the style of &AElig;schylus
with that of Euripides in balances. A single phrase of the
former's causes a score of the latter's to kick the beam; and as
the sonorous nouns, flanked by their polysyllabic epithets, advance,
the earth is seen to shake as though battalions were hurrying
to the charge, and squadrons of cavalry with thundering
horses' hoofs and waving plumes were prancing on the plain.</p>

<p>The difficulty of &AElig;schylus, when it is not due, as in the <i>Suppliants</i>
and in the choric odes of the <i>Agamemnon</i>, to a ruined
text, may be ascribed to the rapidity of his transition from one
thought to another, to the piling-up of images and metaphors,
and to the remote and mystic nature of the ideas he is seeking
for the first time to express in language. Where even simple
prose could scarcely convey his meaning, he presents a cloud of
highly poetic figures to our mind. This kind of difficulty, however,
like that which the student has to meet in Pindar, is straightforward.
You know when you are at fault, and why, and how
alone you can arrive at a solution of the problem. The difficulty
of Sophocles is more insidious. It is possible to think you understand
him, when you really do not; to feel his drift, and yet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
find it hard to construe his language. In this case the difficulty
arises from the poet's desire to convey his meaning in a subtle,
many-sided, pregnant, and yet smooth style. The more you think
over it, the more you get from it. Euripides belonged to an age
of facile speech, fixed phraseology, and critical analysis: it therefore
follows that he presents fewer obvious difficulties to the reader;
and this, perhaps, was one reason for his popularity among
the early scholars of the modern age. At any rate, he does not
share with &AElig;schylus the difficulty that arose when a poet of intense
feeling and sublime imagination strove to grapple with deep
and intricate thoughts before language had become a scientific instrument.</p>

<p>In conclusion I would once again return to that doctrine of
&#960;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#956;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, connected with a definite conception of the
divine government and based upon a well-considered theory of
human responsibility, which may be traced throughout the plays
of &AElig;schylus. To this morality his drama owes its unity and vigor,
inasmuch as all the plots constructed by the poet both presuppose
and illustrate it. The conviction that what a man sows he
will reap, and that the world is not ruled by blind chance, is, in
one sense or another, the most solid ethical acquisition of humanity.
Amid so much else that seems to shift in morals and in religion,
it affords firm ground for action. This vital moral faith
the Greeks held as securely, at least, as we do; and the theology
with which their highest teachers&mdash;men like &AElig;schylus, Pindar,
Plato&mdash;sought to connect it, tended to weaken its effect far less
than any other systems of divinity have done. We are too apt
to forget this, while we fix our attention upon the unrivalled beauty
of Greek art. In reality there are few nations whose fine literature
combines so much &aelig;sthetic splendor with direct, sound,
moral doctrine; and this, not because the poets strove to preach,
but because their minds were healthily imbued with hum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>an wisdom.
Except in the works of Milton, we English, for example,
can show no poetical exposition of a moral theory at all equal to
that of &AElig;schylus. But while Milton sets forth his doctrine as a
portion of divine revelation, and vitiates it with the dross of dogmatism,
&AElig;schylus shows the law implicit in the history of men
and heroes: it is inferred by him intuitively from the facts of
spiritual life, as apprehended by the consciousness of the Greeks
in their best age.</p>

<p>Sophocles, the son of Sophilus, was born at Colonus, a village
about one mile to the north-west of Athens, in the year 495 B.C.
This date makes him thirty years younger than &AElig;schylus, and
fifteen older than Euripides. His father was a man of substance,
capable of giving the best education, intellectual and physical, to
his son; and the education in vogue at Athens when Sophocles
was a boy was that which Aristophanes praised so glowingly in
the speeches of the Dikaios Logos. Therefore, in the case of this
most perfect poet, the best conditions of training (&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;) were
added to the advantages of nature (&#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#962;), and these two essential
elements of a noble manhood, upon which the theorists of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
Greece loved to speculate, were realized by him conjointly in felicitous
completeness. Early in life Sophocles showed that nature
had endowed him with personal qualities peculiarly capable
of conferring lustre on a Greek artist of the highest type. He
was exceedingly beautiful and well-formed, and so accomplished
in music and gymnastics that he gained public prizes in both
these branches of a Greek boy's education. His physical grace
and skill in dancing caused him to be chosen, in his sixteenth
year, to lead the choir in celebration of the victory of Salamis.
According to Athenian custom, he appeared on this occasion naked,
crowned, and holding in his hand a lyre:</p>

<span class="i0">&#954;&#945;&#8055; &#956;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8054; &#960;&#945;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962; &#966;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#957; &#916;&#953;&#959;&#957;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#962; &#967;&#959;&#961;&#8057;&#957;.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These facts are not unimportant, for no Greek poet was more
thoroughly, consistently, and practically &#949;&#8016;&#966;&#965;&#8053;&#962;, according to the
comprehensive meaning of that term, which denotes physical, as
well as moral and intellectual, distinction. The art of Sophocles
is distinguished above all things by its faultless symmetry, its
grace and rhythm, and harmonious equipoise of strength and
beauty. In his own person the poet realized the ideal combination
of varied excellences which his tragedies exhibit. The artist
and the man were one in Sophocles. In his healthful youth
and sober manhood, no less than in his serene poetry, he exhibited
the pure and tempered virtues of &#949;&#8016;&#966;&#965;&#8055;&#945;. We cannot but
think of him as specially created to represent Greek art in its
most refined and exquisitely balanced perfection. It is impossible
to imagine a more plastic nature, a genius more adapted to its
special function, more fittingly provided with all things needful to
its full development, born at a happier moment in the history of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>the world, and more nobly endowed with physical qualities suited
to its intellectual capacity.</p>

<p>In 468 B.C. Sophocles first appeared as a tragic poet in contest
with &AElig;schylus. The advent of the consummate artist was both
auspicious and dramatic. His fame, as a gloriously endowed
youth, had been spread far and wide. The supremacy of his
mighty predecessor remained as yet unchallenged. Therefore the
day on which they met in rivalry was a great national occasion.
Party feeling ran so high that Apsephion, the Archon Eponymus,
who had to name the judges, chose no meaner umpires than the
general Cimon and his colleagues, just returned from Scyros,
bringing with them the bones of the Attic hero Theseus. Their
dignity and their recent absence from the city were supposed to
render them fair critics in a matter of such moment. Cimon
awarded the victory to Sophocles. It is greatly to be regretted
that we have lost the tragedies which were exhibited on this occasion;
we do not know, indeed, with any certainty, their titles.
As Welcker has remarked, the judges were called to decide, not
so much between two poets as between two styles of tragedy;
and if Plutarch's assertion, that &AElig;schylus retired to Sicily in
consequence of the verdict given against him, be well founded,
we may also believe that two rival policies in the city were opposed,
two types of national character in collision. &AElig;schylus belonged
to the old order. Sophocles was essentially a man of the
new age, of the age of Pericles and Pheidias and Thucydides.
The incomparable intellectual qualities of the Athenians of that
brief blossom-time have so far dazzled modern critics that we
have come to identify their spirit with the spirit itself of the
Greek race. Undoubtedly the glories of Hellas, her special <i>geist</i>
in art and thought and state-craft, attained at that moment to
maturity through the felicitous combination of external circumstances,
and through the prodigious mental greatness of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
who made Athens so splendid and so powerful. Yet we must
not forget that Themistocles preceded Pericles, while Cleon followed
after; that Herodotus came before Thucydides, and that
Aristotle, at a later date, philosophized on history; that &AElig;schylus
and Euripides have each a shrine in the same temple with
Sophocles. And all these men, whose names are notes of differences
deep and wide, were Greeks, almost contemporaneous. The
later and the earlier groups in this triple series are, perhaps, even
more illustrative of Greece at large; while the Periclean trio represent
Athenian society, in a special and narrow sense, at its most
luminous and brilliant, most isolated and artificial, most self-centred
and consummate point of &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8049;&#961;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#945; or internal adequacy.
Sophocles was the poet of this transient phase of Attic culture,
unexampled in the history of the world for its clear and flawless
character, its purity of intellectual type, its absolute clairvoyance,
and its plenitude of powers matured, but unimpaired, by use.</p>

<p>From the date 468 to the year of his death, at the age of ninety,
Sophocles composed one hundred and thirteen plays. In
twenty contests he gained the first prize; he never fell below the
second place. After &AElig;schylus he only met one formidable rival,
Euripides. What we know about his life is closely connected
with the history of his works. In 440 B.C., after the production
of the <i>Antigone</i>, he was chosen, on account of his political
wisdom, as one of the generals associated with Pericles in the expedition
to Samos. But Sophocles was not, like &AElig;schylus, a soldier;
nor was he in any sense a man of action. The stories told
about his military service turn wholly upon his genial temperament,
serene spirits, unaffected modesty, and pleasure-loving personality.
So great, however, was the esteem in which his character
for wisdom and moderation was held by his fellow-citizens
that they elected him in 413 B.C. one of the ten commissioners
of public safety, or &#960;&#961;&#8057;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#953;, after the failure of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>Syracusan
expedition. In this capacity he gave his assent to the formation
of the governing council of the Four Hundred two years later,
thus voting away the constitutional liberties of Athens. It is recorded
that he said this measure was not a good one, but the best
under bad circumstances. It should, however, be said that doubt
has been thrown over this part of the poet's career; it is not certain
that the Sophocles in question was in truth the author of
<i>Antigone</i>.</p>

<p>One of the best-authenticated and best-known episodes in the
life of Sophocles is connected with the <i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i>. As an
old man, he had to meet a lawsuit brought against him by his
legitimate son Iophon, who accused him of wishing to alienate
his property to the child of his natural son Ariston. This boy,
called Sophocles, was the darling of his later years. The poet
was arraigned before a jury of his tribe, and the plea set up by
Iophon consisted of an accusation of senile incapacity. The
poet, preserving his habitual calmness, recited the famous chorus
which contains the praises of Colonus. Whereupon the judges
rose and conducted him with honor to his house, refusing for a
moment to consider so frivolous and unwarranted a charge.</p>

<p>Personally Sophocles was renowned for his geniality and equability
of temper; &#949;&#8020;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#952;&#8049;&#948;' &#949;&#8020;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#948;' &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150; is the terse and
emphatic description of his character by Aristophanes. That he
was not averse to pleasures of the sense is proved by evidence as
good as that on which such biographical details of the ancients
generally rest. To slur these stories over because they offend
modern notions of propriety is feeble, though, of course, it is always
open to the critic to call in question the authorities; and in
this particular instance the witnesses are far from clear. The
point, however, to be remembered is that, supposing them true to
fact, Sophocles would himself have smiled at such unphilosophical
partisanship as seeks to overthrow them in the interest of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
reputation. That a poet, distinguished for his physical beauty,
should refrain from sensual enjoyments in the flower of his age
is not a Greek, but a Christian notion. Such abstinence would
have indicated in Sophocles mere want of inclination. The words
of Pindar are here much to the purpose:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#967;&#961;&#8134;&#957; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#948;&#961;&#8051;&#960;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, &#952;&#965;&#956;&#8051;, &#963;&#8058;&#957; &#7937;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#8055;&#8115;.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All turned upon the &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8056;&#957;, and no one had surely a better
sense of the &#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8057;&#962;, the proper time and season for all things, than
Sophocles. He showed his moderation&mdash;which quality, not total
abstinence, was virtue in such matters for the Greeks&mdash;by knowing
how to use his passions, and when to refrain from their indulgence.
The whole matter is summed up in this passage from
the <i>Republic</i> of Plato: "How well I remember the aged poet
Sophocles, when, in answer to the question, 'How does love suit
with age, Sophocles&mdash;are you still the man you were?' 'Peace,'
he replied; 'most gladly have I escaped from that, and I feel as
if I had escaped from a mad and furious master.'"</p>

<p>A more serious defect in the character of Sophocles is implied
in the hint given by Aristophanes, that he was too fond of money.
The same charge was brought against many Greek poets.
We may account for it by remembering that the increased splendor
of Athenian life, and the luxuriously refined tastes of the tragedian,
must have tempted him to do what the Greeks very much
disliked&mdash;make profit by the offspring of his brain. To modern
notions nothing can sound stranger than the invectives of the
philosophers against sophists who sold their wisdom; it can only
be paralleled by their deeply rooted misconceptions about interest
on capital, which even Aristotle regarded as unnatural and criminal.
That Sophocles was in any deeper sense avaricious or miserly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>we cannot believe: it would contradict the whole tenor of the
tales about his geniality and kindness.</p>

<p>Unlike &AElig;schylus and Euripides, Sophocles never quitted Athens,
except on military service. He lived and wrote there through
his long career of laborious devotion to the highest art. We
have, therefore, every right, on this count also, to accept his tragedies
as the purest mirror of the Athenian mind at its most brilliant
period. Athens, in the age of Pericles, was adequate to the
social and intellectual requirements of her greatest sons; and a
poet whose earliest memories were connected with Salamis may
well have felt that even the hardships of the Peloponnesian war
were easier to bear within the sacred walls of the city than exile
under the most favorable conditions. No other centre of so
much social and political activity existed. Athens was the Paris
of Greece, and Sophocles and Socrates were the Parisians of Athens.
At the same time the stirring events of his own lifetime do
not appear to have disturbed the tranquillity of Sophocles. True
to his destiny, he remained an artist; and to this immersion in his
special work he owed the happiness which Phrynichus recorded
in these famous lines:</p>

</div></div>

<p>The change effected by Sophocles in tragedy tended to mature
the drama as a work of pure art, and to free it further from the
Dionysiac traditions. He broke up the trilogy into separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
plays, exhibiting three tragedies and a satyric drama, like &AElig;schylus
before him, but undoing the link by which they were connected,
so that he was able to make each an independent poem.
He added a third actor, and enlarged the number of the chorus,
while he limited its function as a motive force in the drama.
These innovations had the effect of reducing the scale upon
which &AElig;schylus had planned his tragedies, and afforded opportunities
for the elaboration of detail. It was more easy for Sophocles
than it had been for &AElig;schylus to exhibit play of character
through the interaction of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. Tragedy left
the remote and mystic sphere of &AElig;schylean theosophy, and confined
herself to purely human arguments. Attention was concentrated
on the dialogue, in which the passions of men in action
were displayed. The dithyrambic element was lost; the choric
odes providing a relief from violent excitement, instead of embodying
the very soul and spirit of the poet's teaching. While
limiting the activity of the chorus, Sophocles did not, like Euripides,
proceed to disconnect it from the tragic interest, or pay less
attention than his predecessors to its songs. On the contrary, his
choric interludes are models of perfection in this style of lyric
poetry, while their subject-matter is invariably connected with
the chief concerns and moral lessons of the drama.</p>

<p>The extant plays of Sophocles are all later than the year 440
B.C. They may safely be said to belong to the period of his finished
style; or, in the language of art criticism, to his third manner.
What this means will appear from a valuable passage in
Plutarch: "Sophocles used to say that, when he had put aside
the tragic pomp of &AElig;schylus, and then the harsh and artificial
manner of his own elaborate style, he arrived in the third place
at a form of speech which is best suited to portray the characters
of men, and is the most excellent." Thus it would appear that
Sophocles had begun his career as a dramatist by the study of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
the language of &AElig;schylus; finding that too turgid and emphatic,
he had fallen into affectation and refinement, and finally had struck
the just medium between the rugged majesty of his master and
the mannered elegance which was in vogue among the sophists.
The result was that peculiar mixture of grace, dignity, and natural
eloquence which scholars know as Sophoclean. It is interesting
to notice that the first among the extant tragedies of Sophocles,
the <i>Antigone</i>, is more remarkable for studied phrase and verbal
subtleties than his later plays. The <i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i>, which is
the last of the whole series, exhibits the style of the poet in its
perfect purity and freedom. A curious critical passage in Plutarch
seems to indicate that the ancients themselves observed the
occasional euphuism of the Sophoclean style as a blemish. It
runs thus: &#956;&#8051;&#956;&#968;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#959; &#948;' &#7940;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#7944;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#955;&#8057;&#967;&#959;&#965; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#8057;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957; ... &#917;&#8016;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#8055;&#948;&#959;&#965;
&#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#8049;&#957;, &#931;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#954;&#955;&#8051;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#955;&#8055;&#945;&#957;.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> "One might
censure the garrulity of Euripides and the inequality of Sophocles."
I am not, however, certain whether this or "linguistic irregularity"
is the right meaning of the word &#7936;&#957;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#955;&#8055;&#945;. Another
censure, passed by Longinus upon Sophocles, points out a defect
which is the very last to be observed in any of the extant tragedies:
"Pindar and Sophocles at one time burn everything before
them in their fiery flight, but often strangely lack the flame
of inspiration, and fall most grievously to earth."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Then he adds:
"Certainly no wise critic would value all the plays of Ion put together
at the same rate as the single tragedy of <i>&#338;dipus</i>." The
importance of these critiques is to prove that the ancients regarded
Sophocles as an unequal, and in some respects a censurable
poet, whence we may infer that only masterpieces belonging to
his later style have been preserved to us, since nothing, to a modern
student, is more obvious than the uniform sustained perfection
of our seven inestimably precious tragedies. A certain tameness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>in the <i>Trachini&aelig;</i>, and a relaxation of dramatic interest in the
last act of the <i>Ajax</i>, are all the faults it is possible to find with
Sophocles.</p>

<p>What Sophocles is reported to have said about his style will
apply to his whole art. The great achievement of Sophocles was
to introduce regularity of proportion, moderation of tone, and
proper balance into tragedy. The Greek phrases &#963;&#965;&#956;&#956;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#8055;&#945;, &#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;,
&#956;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;&mdash;proportion of parts, self-restraint, and moderation&mdash;sum
up the qualities of his drama when compared with
that of &AElig;schylus. &AElig;schylus rough-hewed like a Cyclops, but he
could not at the same time finish like Praxiteles. What the truth
of this saying is, I have already tried to show.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Sophocles attempted
neither Cyclopean nor Praxitelean work. He attained
to the perfection of Pheidias. Thus we miss in his tragedies the
colossal scale and terrible effects of &AElig;schylean art. His plays are
not so striking at first sight, because it was his aim to put all the
parts of his composition in their proper places, and to produce a
harmony which should not agitate or startle, but which upon due
meditation should be found complete. The &#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;, or moderation,
exhibited in all his work, implies by its very nature the sacrifice
of something&mdash;the sacrifice of passion and impetuosity to
higher laws of equability and temper. So perfect is the beauty
of Sophocles, that, as in the case of Raphael or Mozart, it seems
to conceal the strength and fire which animate his art.</p>

<p>Aristotle, in the <i>Poetics</i>, observes that "Poetry is the proper
affair of either enthusiastic or artistic natures," &#949;&#8016;&#966;&#965;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#7970; &#956;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8166;.
Now &AElig;schylus exactly answers to the notion of the &#956;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#962;, while
Sophocles corresponds to that of the &#949;&#8016;&#966;&#965;&#8053;&#962;. To this distinction
between the two types of genius we may refer the partiality of
Aristotle for the younger dramatist. The work of the artistic
poet is more instructive and offers more matter for profitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>analysis, for precept and example, than that of the divinely inspired
enthusiast. Where creative intelligence has been used consciously
and effectively to a certain end, critical intelligence can
follow. It is clear that in the <i>Poetics</i>, which we may regard as a
practical text-book for students, the philosopher is using the tragedy
of Sophocles, and in particular the <i>&#338;dipus Tyrannus</i>, as the
standard of perfection. Whatever he has to say about the handling
of character, the treatment of the fable, the ethics of the
drama, the catastrophes and recognitions (&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#8051;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#953; and &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#8055;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;),
that absorbed so large a part of his dramatic analysis, he
points by references to <i>&#338;dipus</i>. In Sophocles Aristotle found
the &#956;&#949;&#963;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;, or intermediate quality, between two extremes, which,
in &aelig;sthetics as in morals, seemed to his Greek mind most excellent.
Consequently he notes all deflections from the Sophoclean
norm as faulty; and, since in his day Euripides led the taste of
the Athenians, he frequently shows how tragic art had suffered by
a deviation from the principles Sophocles illustrated. The chief
point on which he insists is the morality of the drama. "The
tragedies of the younger poets for the most part are unethical."
With his use of the word &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; we must be careful not to confound
the modern notion of morality: &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; means, indeed, with
Aristotle as with us, the determination of the character to goodness
or badness; but it also includes considerations of what is appropriate
to sex and quality and circumstance in the persons of
a work of fiction. The best modern equivalent for &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962;, therefore,
is character. Since tragedy is an imitation of men acting
according to their character, &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962;, in this wide sense, is the whole
stuff of the dramatist, and a proper command of &#7974;&#952;&#959;&#962; implies real
knowledge of mankind. Therefore, when Aristotle accuses the
tragedies of Euripides and his school of being "unethical," he
does not merely mean that they were prejudicial to good manners,
but also that they were false to human nature, unscientific,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
and therefore inartistic; exceptional or morbid, wavering in their
conception and unequal in their execution. The truly great poet,
Sophocles, shows his artistic tact and taste by only selecting such
characters as are suitable to tragedy. He depicts men, but men
of heroic mould, men as they ought to be.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> When Sophocles
said that he portrayed men as tragedy required them to be, whereas
Euripides drew them just as they are, he indicated the real
solution of the tragic problem.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The point here raised by Aristotle
has an intimate connection with its whole theory of tragedy.
Tragic poetry must purify the passions of fear and pity; in other
words, it must teach men not to fear when fear is vile, or to pity
where pity would be thrown away. By exhibiting a spectacle
that may excite the fear of really dreadful calamity, and compassion
for truly terrible misfortune, tragedy exalts the soul above
the ordinary miseries of life, and nerves it to face the darker evils
to which humanity in its blindness, sin, and self-pride is exposed.
Now this lesson cannot be taught by drawing men as they exist
around us. That method drags the mind back to the trivialities
of every day.</p>

<p>What Aristotle says about the &#7972;&#952;&#951; of tragedy may be applied
to point the differences between Sophocles and &AElig;schylus. He
has not himself drawn the comparison; but it is clear that, as
Euripides deflects on the one hand from the purely ethical standard,
so also does &AElig;schylus upon the other. &AElig;schylus keeps us
in the high and mystic region of religious fatalism. Sophocles
transports us into the more human region of morality. His problem
is to exhibit the complexities of life&mdash;"whatsoever has passion
or admiration in all the changes of that which is called fortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>from without, or the wily subtleties and reflexes of man's
thoughts from within"&mdash;and to set forth men of noble mental
stature acting in subjection to the laws appointed for the order
of the world. His men and women are like ourselves, only larger
and better in so far as they are simpler and more beautiful. Like
the characters of &AElig;schylus, they suffer for their sins; but we feel
that the justice that condemns them is less mystic in its operation,
more capable of philosophical analysis and scientific demonstration.</p>

<p>It must not be thought, therefore, that Sophocles is less religious
than &AElig;schylus. On the contrary, he shows how the will and
passion of men are inevitably and invariably related to divine justice.
Human affairs can only be understood by reference to the
deity; for the decrees of Zeus, or of that power which is above
Zeus, and which he also obeys, give their moral complexion to the
motives and the acts of men. Yet, while &AElig;schylus brings his theosophy
in detail prominently forward, Sophocles prefers to maintain
a sense of the divine background. He spiritualizes religion,
while he makes it more indefinite. By the same process it is rendered
more impregnable within its stronghold of the human heart
and reason, less exposed to the attacks of logic or the changes of
opinion. The keynote to his tragic morality is found in these
two passages:<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Oh! that my lot may lead me in the path of holy innocence of word and
deed, the path which august laws ordain, laws that in the highest empyrean
had their birth, of which heaven is the father alone, neither did the race of
mortal man beget them, nor shall oblivion ever put them to sleep. The power
of God is mighty in them, and groweth not old."</p></div>

<p>The second is like unto the first in spirit:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was no Zeus who thus commanded me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Justice, dread mate of the nether powers,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor did I fondly deem thy proclamations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were so infallible that any mortal<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The religious instinct in Sophocles has made a long step towards
independence since the days of &AElig;schylus. No more upon
Olympus or at Delphi alone will the Greek poet worship. He
has learned that "God is a spirit, and they that worship him
must worship him in spirit and in truth." The voice that speaks
within him is the deity he recognizes. At the same time the
Chorus of the <i>&#338;dipus</i>, part of which has just been quoted, and
that of the <i>Antigone</i>, which bewails the old doom of the house
of Labdacus, might, but for their greater calmness, have been written
by &AElig;schylus. The moral doctrine of Greek tragedy has not
been changed, but humanized. We have got rid in a great measure
of ancient demons, and brass-footed Furies, and the greed of
earth for blood in recompense for blood. We have passed, as it
were, from the shadow cast by the sun into the sunlight itself.
And, in consequence of this transfiguration, the morality of Sophocles
is imperishable. "Not of to-day nor of yesterday, but fixed
from everlasting," are his laws. We may all learn of him now,
as when Antigone first stood before the throne of Creon on the
Attic stage. The deep insight into human life, that most precious
gift of the Greek genius, which produced their greatest contributions
to the education of the world, is in Sophocles obscured no
longer by mystical mythology and local superstition. His wisdom
is the common heritage of human nature.</p>

<p>The moral judgments of &AElig;schylus were se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>vere. Those of
Sophocles, implicit in his tragic situations rather than expressed,
are not less firm; but he seems to feel a more tender pity for
humanity in its weakness and its blindness. The philosophy of
life, profoundly sad upon the one side, but cheerful on the other,
which draws lessons of sobriety and tempered joy from the consideration
of human impotence and ignorance, is truly Greek.
We find it nowhere more strongly set forth than by Sophocles
and Aristophanes&mdash;by the comic poet in the Parabasis of the
<i>Birds</i>, and in the songs of the Myst&aelig; in the <i>Frogs</i>, by the tragic
poet in his choruses, and also in what is called his irony.</p>

<p>All that has been said about the art of Sophocles up to this
point has tended to establish one position. His innate and unerring
tact, his sense of harmony and measure, produced at Athens
a new style of drama, distinguished for finish of language, for
careful elaboration of motives, for sharp and delicate character-drawing,
and for balance of parts. If we do not find in Sophocles
anything to match the passion of Cassandra, the cry of Agamemnon,
or the opening of the <i>Eumenides</i>, there is yet in his
plays a combination of quite sufficient boldness and inventiveness
with more exquisite workmanship than &AElig;schylus could give.
The breadth of the whole is not lost through the minuteness of
the details. Unlike &AElig;schylus, Sophocles opens very quietly,
with conversations, for the most part, which reveal the characters
of the chief persons or explain the situation. The passion grows
with the development of the plot, and it is only when the play is
finished that justice can be done to any separate part. Each of
the seven tragedies presents one person, who dominates the drama,
and in whom its interest is principally concentrated. &#338;dipus in
his two plays, Antigone in hers, Philoctetes in his, Deianeira in
the <i>Trachini&aelig;</i>, Electra in her play, and Ajax in his, stand forth in
powerful and prominent relief. Then come figures on the second
plane, no less accurately conceived and conscientiously delineated,
but used with a view to supporting the chief personages, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
educing their decisive action.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> A <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of this kind is given to
Orestes in the <i>Electra</i>, to Neoptolemus in the <i>Philoctetes</i>, to Teucer
in the <i>Ajax</i>, to Creon in the <i>Antigone</i>, to Teiresias in the <i>&#338;dipus</i>.
Clytemnestra and Tecmessa, Odysseus and Theseus, play
similar parts. Again, there is a third plane for characters still
more subordinate, but no less artistically important, such as Jocasta,
Ismene, Chrysothemis, &AElig;gisthus, Hyllus. Then follow the
numerous accessory persons&mdash;<i>instrumenta dramatis</i>&mdash;the guardian
of the corpse of Polyneices, the shepherd of Laius, the tutor of
Orestes, messengers and servants, all of whom receive their special
physiognomy from the great master. In this way Sophocles
made true &aelig;sthetic use of the three agonist&aelig;. The principle on
which these parts were distributed in his tragedies will be found
to have deep and subtle analogies with the laws of bass-relief in
sculpture. Poetry, however, being a far more independent art
than sculpture, may employ a greater multiplicity of parts, and
produce a far more complex effect than can be realized in bass-relief.</p>

<p>The <i>Philoctetes</i> might be selected as an example of the power
in handling motives possessed by Sophocles. The amount of interest
he has concentrated by a careful manipulation of one point&mdash;the
contest for the bow of Herakles&mdash;upon so slight and stationary
a plot, is truly wonderful. Not less admirable is the contrast
between the youthful generosity of Neoptolemus and the
worldly wisdom of Odysseus&mdash;the young man pliant at first to
the crafty persuasions of the elder, but restored to his sense of
honor by the compassion which Philoctetes stirs, and by the trust
he places in him. Nothing more beautiful can be conceived than
this moral revolution in the character of Neoptolemus. It suited
the fine taste and exquisite skill of Sophocles not only to exhibit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>changes in circumstance and character, but also to compel a change
of sympathy and of opinion in his audience. Thus, in the <i>Ajax</i>,
he contrives to reverse the whole situation, by showing in the end
Ajax sublime and Odysseus generous, though at first the one
seemed sunk below humanity, and the other hateful in his vulgar
scorn of a fallen rival. The art which works out psychological
problems of this subtle kind, and which invests a plot like that
of the <i>Philoctetes</i> with intense interest, is very far removed from
the method of &AElig;schylus. The difference between the two styles
may, however, be appreciated best by a comparison of the <i>Electra</i>
with the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>. In these two tragedies very nearly the same
motives are employed; but what was simple and straightforward
in &AElig;schylus becomes complex and involved in Sophocles. Instead
of Orestes telling the tale of his own death, we have the
narrative of his tutor, confirmed and ratified by himself in person.
Instead of Electra at once recognizing her brother, she is brought
at first to the verge of despair by hearing of his death. Then
Chrysothemis informs her of the lock of hair. This, however,
cannot reassure Electra in the face of the tutor's message. So
the situation is admirably protracted. &AElig;schylus misses all that
is gained for the development of character by the resolve of Electra,
stung to desperation by her brother's death, to murder &AElig;gisthus,
and by the contrast between her single-hearted daring and
the feebler acquiescent temper of Chrysothemis. Also the peripeteia
whereby Electra is made to bewail the urn of Orestes, and
then to discover him alive before her, is a stroke of supreme art
which was missed in the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>. The pathos of the situation
is almost too heart-rending; at one moment its intensity
verges upon discord; but the resolution of the discord comes in
that long cadence of triumphant harmony when the anagnorisis
at length arrives. Nor is the ingenuity of Sophocles, in continuing
and sustaining the interest of this one set of motives, yet <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>exhausted.
While the brother and sister are rejoicing together, the
action waits, and every moment becomes more critical, until at
last the tutor reappears and warns them of their perilous imprudence.
To take another point: the dream of Clytemnestra is
more mysterious and doubtful in the <i>Electra</i> than in the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>;
while her appearance on the stage at the beginning of
the play, her arguments with Electra, her guarded prayers to Ph&#339;bus,
and her reception of the tutor's message, enable Sophocles
fully to develop his conception of her character. On the other
hand, Sophocles has sacrificed the most brilliant features of the
<i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>&mdash;the dreadful scene of Clytemnestra's death, than
which there is nothing more passionately piteous and spirit-quelling
in all tragedy, and the descent of his mother's furies on the
murderer. It was the object of Sophocles not so much to dwell
upon the action of Orestes as to exhibit the character of Electra;
therefore, at the supreme moment, when the cry of the queen is
heard within the palace, he shows his heroine tremendous in her
righteous hatred and implacable desire for vengeance. Such complete
and exhaustive elaboration of motives, characters, and situations,
as forms the chief artistic merit of the <i>Electra</i>, would, perhaps,
have been out of place in the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i>, which was only
the second play in a trilogy, and had, therefore, to be simple and
stationary, according to the principles of &AElig;schylean art. The
character of Clytemnestra, for example, needed no development,
seeing that she had taken the first part in the <i>Agamemnon</i>.
Again, it was necessary for &AElig;schylus to insist upon the action
of Orestes more than Sophocles was forced to do, in order that
the climax of the <i>Cho&euml;phor&#339;</i> might produce the subject of the
<i>Eumenides</i>. In comparing Sophocles with his predecessor, we
must never forget that we are comparing single plays with trilogies.
This does not, however, make the Sophoclean mastery of
motives and of plots the less admirable; it only fixes our atte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>ntion
on the real nature of the innovations adopted by the younger
dramatist.</p>

<p>Another instance of the art wherewith Sophocles prepared a
tragic situation, and graduated all the motives which should conduct
the action to a final point, may be selected from the <i>&#338;dipus
Colone&uuml;s</i>. It was necessary to describe the death of &#338;dipus,
since the fable selected for treatment precluded anything approaching
to a presentation on the stage of this supreme event.
&#338;dipus is bound to die alone mysteriously, delivering his secret
first in solitude to Theseus. A Messenger's speech was, therefore,
imperatively demanded, and to render that the climax of the
drama taxed all the resources of the poet. First comes thunder,
the acknowledged signal of the end. Then the speech of &#338;dipus,
who says that now, though blind, he will direct his steps unhelped.
Theseus is to follow and to learn. &#338;dipus rises from
his seat; his daughters and the king attend him. They quit the
stage, and the Chorus is left alone to sing. Then comes the
Messenger, and gives the sublime narration of his disappearance.
We hear the voice that called&mdash;</p>

<p>We see the old man descending the mysterious stairs, Antigone
and Ismene grouped above, and last, the kneeling king, who
shrouds his eyes before a sight intolerable. All this, as in a
picture, passes before our imagination. To convey the desired
effect otherwise than by a narrative would have been impossible,
and the narrative, owing to the expectation previously raised, is
adequate.</p>

<p>To compare Sophocles with Euripides, after having said so
much about the points of contrast between him and &AElig;schylus,
and to determine how much he may have owed in his later p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>lays
to the influence of the younger poet, would be an interesting exercise
of criticism. That, however, belongs rather to an essay dealing
directly with the third Greek dramatist in detail. It is sufficient
here to notice a few points in which Sophocles seems to
have prepared the way for Euripides. In the first place he developed
the part of the Messenger, and made far more of picturesque
description than &AElig;schylus had done. Then, again, his
openings suggested the device of the prologue by their abandonment
of the eminently scenic effects with which &AElig;schylus preferred
to introduce a drama. The separation of the Chorus from
the action was another point in which Sophocles led onward to
Euripides. So also was the device of the <i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i> in the
<i>Philoctetes</i>, unless, indeed, we are to regard this as an invention
adopted from Euripides.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Nor, in this connection, is it insignificant
that Aristotle credits Sophocles with the invention of &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8055;&#945;,
or scene-painting. The abuse of scenical resources to the
detriment of real dramatic unity and solidity was one of the chief
defects of Euripidean art.</p>

<p>It may here be noticed that Sophocles in the <i>Trachini&aelig;</i> took
up the theme of love as a main motive for a drama. By doing
so he broke ground in a region that had been avoided, as far as
we can judge from extant plays, by &AElig;schylus, and in which Euripides
was destined to achieve his greatest triumphs. It is, indeed,
difficult to decide the question of precedence between Sophocles
and Euripides in this matter. Except on this account the
<i>Trachini&aelig;</i> is the least interesting of his tragedies. The whole
play seems like a somewhat dull, though conscientious, handling
of a fable in which the poet took but a slight interest. Compared
with Medea or with Ph&aelig;dra, Deianeira is tame and lifeless.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>She makes one fatal and foolish mistake through jealousy, and all
is over. Hyllus, too, is a mere <i>silhouette</i>, while the contention
between him and Herakles about the marriage with Iole, at the
end, is frigid. Here, if anywhere, we detect the force of the
critique quoted above from Longinus. At the same time the
<i>Trachini&aelig;</i> offers many points of interest to the student of Greek
sentiment. The phrase &#964;&#945;&#8059;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#8001; &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#7989;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962; is significant, as
expressing the pain and forceful energy which the Greeks attributed
to passion; nor is the contrast drawn by Deianeira
between &#960;&#8057;&#963;&#953;&#962; and &#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961; without value. The motive used by
Sophocles in this tragedy was developed by Euripides with a
comprehension so far deeper, and with a fulness so far more
satisfactory, that the <i>Hippolytus</i> and the <i>Medea</i> must always
take rank above it.</p>

<p>The deepest and most decisive quality in which the tragic art
of Sophocles resembled that of Euripides is rhetoric. Sophocles
was the first to give its full value to dramatic casuistry, to introduce
sophistic altercations, and to set forth all that could be
well said in support of a poor argument. A passage on this
subject may be quoted from "Eckermann's Conversations with
Goethe:"<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"That is the very thing," said Goethe, "in which Sophocles is a master;
and in which consists the very life of the dramatic in general. His characters
all possess this gift of eloquence, and know how to explain the motives
for their action so convincingly that the hearer is almost always on the side
of the last speaker. One can see that in his youth he enjoyed an excellent
rhetorical education, by which he became trained to look for all the reasons
and seeming reasons of things. Still his great talent in this respect betrayed
him into faults, as he sometimes went too far."</p></div>

<p>The special point selected by Goethe for criticism is the celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>last speech of Antigone:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At last, when she is led to death, she brings forward a motive which is
quite unworthy, and almost borders on the comic. She says that if she had
been a mother she would not have done either for her dead children or for
her dead husband what she has done for her brother. 'For,' says she, 'if my
husband died I could have had another, and if my children died I could have
had others by my new husband. But with my brother the case is different.
I cannot have another brother; for since my mother and father are dead,
there is none to beget one.' This is, at least, the bare sense of the passage,
which, in my opinion, when placed in the mouth of a heroine going to her
death, disturbs the tragic tone, and appears to me very far-fetched&mdash;to savor
too much of dialectical calculation. As I said, I should like a philologist to
show us that the passage is spurious."</p></div>

<p>In truth this last speech of Antigone is exactly what the severer
critics of Euripides would have selected in a play of his for condemnation.
It exhibits, after all allowance for peculiar Greek
sentiments, the rhetorical development of a sophistic thesis. In
the simple thought there is pathos. But its elaboration makes it
frigid.</p>

<p>Sophocles, though he made the subsequent method of Euripides
not only possible but natural by the law of progressive evolution,
was very far indeed from disintegrating the tragic structure
as Euripides was destined to do. The <i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i> of the
<i>Philoctetes</i>, for example, was only employed because there was
absolutely no other way to solve the situation. Rhetoric and
wrangling matches were never introduced for their own sake.
The choric odes did not degenerate into mere musical interludes.
Description and narration in no case took the place of action, by
substituting pictures to the ear under conditions where true art
required dramatic presentation. It remains the everlasting glory
of Sophocles that he realized the mean between &AElig;schylus and
Euripides, sacrificing for the sake of his ideal the passionate and
enthusiastic extremes of the older dramatist, without imperilling
the fabric of Greek tragedy by the suicidal innovations of Euripide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>s.
He and he alone knew how to use all forms of art, to express
all motives, and to hazard all varieties, with the single purpose
of maintaining artistic unity.</p>

<p>What remains to be said about Sophocles, and in particular
about his delineation of character, may be introduced in the
course of an analysis of his tragedies upon the tale of Thebes.</p>

<p>These three plays do not, like the three plays of &AElig;schylus
upon the tale of the Atrid&aelig;, form a trilogy. That is to say, they
are not so connected in subject as to form one continued series.
A drama, for example, similar to the <i>Seven against Thebes</i> might
be interpolated between the <i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i> and <i>Antigone</i>;
while the <i>&#338;dipus Tyrannus</i> might have been followed by a
tragedy upon the subject of the king's expulsion from Thebes.
Nor, again, are they artistically designed as a trilogy. There is
no change of form, suggesting the beginning, middle, and ending
of a calculated work of art, like that which we notice in the
<i>Oresteia</i>. Moreover, the protagonist is absent from the <i>Antigone</i>,
and, therefore, to call the three plays an <i>&#338;dipodeia</i> is impossible.
Finally, they were composed at different periods: the <i>Antigone</i> is
the first extant tragedy of Sophocles; the <i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i> is the
last.</p>

<p>So much it was necessary to premise in order to avoid the imputation
of having treated the three masterpieces of Sophocles as
in any true sense a trilogy. The temptation to do so is at first
sight almost irresistible; for they are written on the same legend,
and the same characters are throughout sustained with firmness,
proving that, though Sophocles composed the last play of the
series first and the second last of all, he had conceived them in
his brain before he undertook to work them out in detail. Or,
if this assumption seem unwarranted, we may at least affirm with
certainty that at some point of time anterior to the production of
the <i>Antigone</i> he had subjected the whole legend of the hou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>se of
Laius to his plastic imagination, and had given it coherence in his
mind. In other words, it was impossible for him to change his
point of view about this mythus in the same way as Euripides
when he handled that of Helen according to two different versions.
It so happens, moreover, that the climax of the <i>&#338;dipus
Tyrannus</i> prepares us, by the revolution in the character of the
protagonist, for the <i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i>; while the last act of the
second tragedy, by the prominence given to Antigone, serves as a
prelude to the third and final play.</p>

<p>The house of Laius was scarcely less famous among the Greeks
than the house of Atreus for its overwhelming disasters, the consequences
of an awful curse which rested on the family. Laius,
the son of Labdacus, was supposed to have introduced an unnatural
vice into Hellas; and from this first crime sprang all the
subsequent disasters of his progeny. He took in marriage Jocasta,
the sister of Prince Creon, and swayed the State of Thebes.
To him an oracle was given that a son of his by Jocasta should
kill him. Yet he did not therefore, in obedience to the divine
warning, put away his wife or live in chastity. A boy was born
to the royal pair, who gave him to one of their shepherds, after
piercing his feet and tying them together, and bound the hind to
expose him on Cith&aelig;ron. Thus they hoped to defeat the will of
heaven. The shepherd, moved by pity, saved the baby's life and
handed him over to a friend of his, who used to feed his master's
sheep upon the same hill-pastures. This man carried the infant,
named &#338;dipus because of his wounded and swollen feet, to Polybus
of Corinth, a childless king, who brought him up as his own
son. &#338;dipus when he had grown to manhood, was taunted with
his obscure birth by his comrades in Corinth. Thereupon he
journeyed alone to Delphi to make inquiry concerning his parentage
from Ph&#339;bus. Ph&#339;bus told him naught thereof, but bade
him take heed lest he slay his father and wed his mother. &#338;dipu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>s,
deeming that Polybus was his father and Merope his mother,
determined to return to Corinth no more. At that time Thebes
was troubled with the visitation of the Sphinx, and no man might
rede her riddle. &#338;dipus, passing through the Theban land, was
met in a narrow path, where three roads joined, by an old man on
a chariot attended by servants. The old man spoke rudely to
him, commanding him to make way for his horses, and one of the
servants struck him. Whereupon &#338;dipus slew the master, knowing
not that he was his own father, Laius, and the men too, all but
one, who fled. Thereafter he passed on to Thebes, and solved
that riddle of the Sphinx, and the Thebans made him their king,
and gave him the lady Jocasta to be his wife. Thus were both
the oracles accomplished, and yet &#338;dipus and Jocasta remained
ignorant of their doom. For many years &#338;dipus ruled Thebes
like a great and warlike prince; and to him and Jocasta in wedlock
were born two daughters and two sons&mdash;Antigone and Ismene,
Polyneices and Eteocles. These grew to youth, and a
seeming calm of fair weather and prosperity abode upon their
house. Yet the gods were mindful of the abomination, and in
course of time a plague was sent, which ravaged the people of
Thebes. Sorely pressed by calamity, &#338;dipus sent his brother-in-law
Creon to inquire at Delphi of the causes of the plague and of
the means of staying it. This brings us to the opening of <i>&#338;dipus
the King</i>. At this point something should be said about the
mythus itself and about the position of the several persons at the
commencement of the tragedy.</p>

<p>The fable is obviously one of those which Max M&uuml;ller and his
school describe as solar. &#338;dipus, who slays his father and weds
his mother, may stand for the Sun, who slays the Night and is married
to the Dawn. We know how all legends can fall into this
mould, and how easy it is to clap the Dawn on to the end of every
Greek tale, like the &#955;&#951;&#954;&#8059;&#952;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#8061;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#957; of the <i>Frogs</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>. This, however,
is nothing to our purpose; for Sophocles had never heard
of solar myths. The tale of Thebes supplied him with the subject
of three dramas; he used it as a story well suited for displaying
passions in their strongest and most tragic workings. As
usual, he was not contented with merely following the traditional
version of the legend, nor did he insist upon its superstitious elements.
That the gods had a grudge against the Labdacid&aelig;, that
the oracles given to Laius and &#338;dipus were not warnings so much
as sinister predictions of a doom inevitable, that the very powers
who uttered them were bent on blinding the victims of fate to
their true import, were thoroughly Greek notions, consistent with
the divine &#966;&#952;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;, or envy, of Herodotus, and not wholly inconsistent
with the gloomy theology of &AElig;schylus. But it was no part
of the method of Sophocles to emphasize this horrible doctrine
of destiny. On the contrary, he moralized it. While preserving
all the essential features of the myth, he made it clear that the
characters of men constitute their fatality.</p>

<p>As our own Fletcher has nobly written:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Man is his own star, and the soul, that can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Render an honest and a perfect man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commands all light, all influence, all fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing to him falls early or too late;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What to the vulgar apprehension appears like doom, and to
the theologian like the direct interposition of the Deity, is to the
tragic poet but the natural consequence of moral, physical, and
intellectual qualities. These it is his function to set forth in high
and stately scenes, commingling with his psychological analysis and
forcible dramatic presentation somewhat of the old religious awe.</p>

<p>It may be urged that this is only shifting the burden of necessit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>y,
not removing it. It is, perhaps, impossible scientifically to
avoid a fatalistic theory of some sort, since in one sense it is true
that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A fish-wife hath a fate, and so have I&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But far above your finding.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet practically we do not act upon such theories, and, from the
point of view of ethics, there is all the difference in the world between
showing how the faults and sins of men must lead them to
fearful ends, and painting them in the grip of a remorseless and
malignant deity.</p>

<p>Laius was warned that his son by Jocasta would kill him. Yet
he begat a son; and in his presumptuous disregard of heaven,
thinking, forsooth, that by mere barbarity a man may cheat the
Omnipotent, and that the All-seeing cannot save a child of prophecy
and doom, he exposed this son upon Cith&aelig;ron. The boy lived.
Thus the crime of Laius is want of self-restraint in the first instance,
contempt of God in the second, and cruelty in the third.
After this, &#338;dipus appears upon the theatre of events. He, too,
receives oracular warning&mdash;that he will slay his sire and wed his
mother. Yet, though well aware of the doubt which rests upon
his own birth&mdash;for it was just on this account that he went to
Delphi&mdash;he is satisfied with avoiding his supposed parents. The
first man whom he meets, while the words of the oracle are still
ringing in his ears, he slays; the first woman who is offered to
him in marriage, though old enough to be his mother, he weds.
His crime is haste of temper, heat of blood, blind carelessness of
the divine decrees. Jocasta shows her guilty infatuation in another
form. Not only does she participate in the first sin of
Laius, but she forgets the oracle which announced that Laius
should be slain by his own son. She makes no inquiry into the
causes of his death. She does not investigate the previous history
of &#338;dipus, or observe the marks upon his feet, but weds
him heedlessly. Here, indeed, the legend itself involves monst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>rous
improbabilities&mdash;as, for instance, that Jocasta, while a widow
of a few days, should have been thus wedded to a stranger
young enough to be her son, that the Thebans should have made
no strict search for the murderer of their king, that &#338;dipus himself
should have heard nothing about the death and funeral of
Laius, but should have stepped incuriously into his place and sat
upon his throne without asking further questions either of his
wife or of his subjects. Previous to the opening of <i>&#338;dipus the
King</i>, there is, therefore, a whole tissue of absurdities; and to
these Aristotle is probably referring when he says: &#7940;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#8050;
&#956;&#951;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#8049;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;, &#949;&#7984; &#948;&#8050; &#956;&#8053;, &#7956;&#958;&#969; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#8179;&#948;&#8055;&#945;&#962;,
&#959;&#7991;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#927;&#7984;&#948;&#8055;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#953; &#964;&#8183; &#931;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#954;&#955;&#8051;&#959;&#965;&#962;.</p>

<p>Granting this, the vigorous logic wherewith the conclusions are
wrought out by Sophocles leaves nothing to be desired on the
score of truth to nature. There is, indeed, no work of tragic art
which can be compared with the <i>&#338;dipus</i> for the closeness and
consistency of the plot. To use the critical terms of the <i>Poetics</i>,
it would rank first among tragedies for its &#956;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#962; and for the &#963;&#8059;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;
&#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#8049;&#964;&#969;&#957;, even were its &#7972;&#952;&#951; far less firmly traced. The
triumph of Sophocles has been, however, so to connect the &#7972;&#952;&#951; of
his persons with the &#960;&#961;&#8049;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, characters with plot, as to make
the latter depend upon the former; and in this kind of ethical
causality lies the chief force of his tragic art.</p>

<p>If questioned concerning the situation of events previous to
the play of <i>&#338;dipus</i>, it is possible that Sophocles would have
pointed out that the &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8055;&#945;, or error common to all the <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i>, was an unwarrantable self-confidence. One and all they
consult the oracle, and then are satisfied with taking the affairs
they had referred to Ph&#339;bus into their own hands. Unlike the
Orestes of &AElig;schylus, they do not endeavor to act up to the divine
commands, and, having done so, place themselves once more
beneath the guidance of the god. The oracle is all-important <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>in
the three plays on the tale of Thebes, and Sophocles seems to
have intended to inculcate a special lesson with regard to the submission
of the human will. Those who inquire of a god, and who
attempt to thwart his decrees by human skill and foresight, will
not prosper. The apparent success of their shifty schemes may
cause them to exclaim: "The oracle was false; how weak are
those who look for its accomplishment!" Thus they are lured
by their self-conceit into impiety. In the end, too, the oracle is
found to be fearfully exact. Those, therefore, who take the step
of consulting Ph&#339;bus must hold themselves responsible to him,
must expect the fulfilment of his prophecy; or if they seek to
avert the promised evils, they must, at all events, not do so by
criminal contrivances and petty lawlessness, such as man thinks
that he may practise upon man. It was thus that Sophocles conceived
of the relation of human beings to the deity. He delights
in exhibiting the blindness of arrogance and self-confidence, and
in showing that characters determined by these qualities rush
recklessly to their own doom. At the same time he draws a clear
distinction between the man who is hardened in godless folly and
one who errs through simple haste. The impiety of Jocasta ends
in suicide. &#338;dipus, who has been impetuous and self-willed,
finds a place for repentance, and survives his worst calamities, to
die a god-protected and god-honored hero.</p>

<p>The opening scene of the <i>&#338;dipus</i> serves a double purpose.
While it places the spectators at the exact point in the legend
selected by the poet for treatment, it impresses them with the
greatness and the majesty of the king. Thebes is worn out with
plague. The hand of Heaven lies heavily upon the citizens. Therefore
the priest of Zeus approaches the hero who once before had
saved them from the Sphinx, and who may now&mdash;fit representative
of God on earth&mdash;find out a remedy for this intolerable evil.
&#338;dipus appears upon the stage, a confident and careful rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>r, sublime
in the strength of manhood and the consciousness of vast
capacity, tender for the afflictions of his people, yet undismayed
by their calamity. He is just the man to sustain a commonwealth
by his firm character and favoring fortune. Flawless in force of
will and singleness of purpose, he seems incapable of failure. To
connect the notions of disgrace or guilt or shame with such a
king is utterly impossible. Yet, even so, Sophocles has hinted in
the speech of &#338;dipus a something overmuch of confidence and
courage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">Well I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye all suffer, yet, thus suffering, I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than you all in overmeasure suffer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that which wounds you strikes at each man singly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At each and not another; while my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Thebes, for me, for you, feels one huge sorrow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even here the irony, for which the play is famous, begins to
transpire. &#338;dipus believes that his grief is sympathy for a vexed
people committed to his charge. Little does he know that, while
he is pluming himself upon his watchful care for others, he himself
is the head and front of all offending. In the word &#954;&#7936;&#956;&#8051;, almost
negligently uttered, lies the kernel of the future revelation.
While he is informing the suppliants that Creon has gone to
Delphi for advice, the prince arrives. A garland of good augury
is on his brow; and in this sign of an auspicious embassy we discern
another stroke of tragic irony. Ph&#339;bus has declared that
the presence in Thebes of the hitherto unpunished, unregarded
murderer of Laius is the cause of the plague. &#338;dipus, when he
fully understands the matter, swears to discover the offender.
The curse which he pronounces on this guilty man is terrible&mdash;terrible
in its energy of interdiction and excommunication from
all rites of hospitality, from human sympathy, from earth and air
and water and the fruits of the field&mdash;but still more terrible
through the fact that all these maledictions are uttered on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
own head. The irony of the situation&mdash;if we are justified in
giving this word to the contrast between what seems and what
really is&mdash;between &#338;dipus as he appears to the burghers and
&#338;dipus as he is known to us&mdash;rises in the emphatic eloquence
of his denunciation to a truly awful height. At the same time
his obvious sincerity enlists our sympathy upon his side. We
feel beforehand that the man who speaks thus will, when his eyes
are opened, submit to his self-imprecated doom. It now remains
to detect the murderer. Thinking that his faculty of divination
may be useful, &#338;dipus has already sent for the blind seer Teiresias.
Teiresias is one of the great creations of Sophocles. Twice
he appears, once in this play, once in the <i>Antigone</i>, each time in
conflict with infatuated kings. He is so aged, and the soul within
him is so fixed on things invisible, that he seems scarcely human.
We think of him as of one who dwells apart, not communing in
ordinary social ways with men, but listening to the unspoken
words of God, and uttering his wisdom in dark parable to those
who heed him not. The Greek poets frequently exhibited the
indifference of prosperous persons to divine monitions. Cassandra's
prophecies were not attended to; the Delphic oracle spoke
in vain; and Teiresias is only honored when it is too late. Sophocles,
while maintaining the mysterious fascination of the soothsayer,
has marked his character by some strong touches of humanity.
He is proud and irritable to excess. His power of sarcasm
is appalling, and his indignation is inexorable. Between
two stubborn and unyielding natures like the seer and king
sparks of anger could not fail to be struck; the explosion that
follows on their meeting serves to display the choleric temper of
&#338;dipus, which formed the main trait of his character, the pith of
his &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8055;&#945;.</p>

<p>&#338;dipus greet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>s Teiresias courteously, telling him that he, the
king, is doing all he can to find the murderer of Laius, and that
the soothsayer must spare no pains. To this generous patronage
and protective welcome Teiresias, upon whose sightless soul
the truth has suddenly flashed, answers with deep sighs, and requests
to be led home again. This naturally nettles &#338;dipus.
The hastiness that drew him into his first fault renders him now
ungovernable. Teiresias keeps saying it will be better for the
king to remain ignorant, and the king retorts that he is only a
blind dotard; were he not blind, he, and no other, might be suspected
of the murder. This provokes an oracular response:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ay! Is it so? I bid thee, then, abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thy first ordinance, and from this day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join not in converse with these men or me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being thyself this land's impure defiler.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus the real state of affairs is suddenly disclosed; and were
&#338;dipus of a submissive temper, he would immediately have proceeded
to the discovery of the truth. This would, however, have
destroyed the drama, and have prevented the unfolding of the
character of the king. Instead, therefore, of heeding the seer's
words, &#338;dipus rushes at once to the conclusion that Creon and
Teiresias are plotting to overthrow him in his tyranny. The
quarrel waxes hot. Each word uttered by Teiresias is pregnant
with terrific revelation. The whole context of events, past, present,
and future, is painted with intense lucidity in speech that has
the trenchant force of oracular conviction; yet &#338;dipus remains
so firmly rooted in his own integrity and in the belief which he
has suddenly assumed of Creon's treason, that he turns deaf ears
and a blind soul to the truth. At last the seer leaves him with
this denunciation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I tell thee this: the man whom thou so long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seekest with threats and mandates for the murder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Laius, that very man is here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By name an alien, but in season due<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He shall be shown true Theban, and small joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall have therein; for, blind, instead of seeing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poor, who once was rich, he shall go forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staff-guided, groping, o'er a foreign land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall be shown to be with his own children<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brother and sire in one, of her who bore him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Husband at once and offspring, of his father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bedmate and murderer. Go; take now these words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within, and weigh them; if thou find me false,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say then that divination taught me nothing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next scene is one of altercation between &#338;dipus and Creon.
&#338;dipus, full of rage, still haunted by the suspicion of treason,
yet stung to the quick by some of the dark speeches of the
prophet, vehemently assails the prince, and condemns him to exile.
Creon&mdash;who, of course, is innocent, but who is not meant
to have a generous or lofty soul&mdash;defends himself in a dry and
argumentative manner, until Jocasta comes forth from the palace
and seeks to quell their conflict. &#338;dipus tells her haughtily that
he is accused of being the murderer of Laius. She begins her
answer with a frivolous and impious assertion that all oracles are
nonsense. The oracle uttered against Laius came to nothing, for
his son died on Mount Cith&aelig;ron, and robbers slew him near
Thebes long afterwards, where three ways meet. These words, &#7952;&#957;
&#964;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#958;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;, stir suspicion in the mind of &#338;dipus. He
asks at once: "Where was the spot?" "In Phokis, where one
goes to Delphi and to Daulia." "What was Laius like?" "Not
unlike you in shape," says Jocasta, "but white-haired." "Who
were with him?" "Five men, and he rode a chariot." "Who
told you all this?" "One who escaped, and who begged me afterwards
to send him from the palace, and who now keeps a farm
of ours in the country." Each answer adds to the certainty in
the mind of &#338;dipus that it was Laius whom he slew. The only
hope left is to send for the servant, and to find out whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span> he
adheres to his story of there having been more robbers than one.
If he remains firm upon this point, and does not confess that it
was one solitary man who slew his master and his comrades, then
there is a chance that he, the king, may not be guilty. Jocasta,
with her usual levity, comforts him by insisting that he spoke of
robbers, in the plural, and that he must not be suffered to retract
his words.</p>

<p>While they are waiting for the servant, a messenger arrives from
Corinth with good news. Polybus, the king, is dead, and &#338;dipus
is proclaimed his successor. "Where now," shouts impious Jocasta,
"are your oracles&mdash;that you should slay your father? See
you not how foolish it is to trust to Ph&#339;bus and to auguries of
birds? Chance is the lord of all. Let us, therefore, live our lives
as best we can." Awful is the irony of these short-sighted jubilations;
and awful, as Aristotle has pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> is the irony
which makes this messenger of apparently good tidings add the
last link to the chain of evidence that will overwhelm &#338;dipus
with ruin. &#338;dipus exclaims: "Though my father is dead, I may
not return to Corinth: Merope still lives." "What," says the
messenger, "do you fear her because she is your mother? Set
your mind at ease. She is no mother of yours, nor was Polybus
your father. I gave you to them as a gift, when you were yet
an infant." "Where did you find me?" cries the king. "Upon
Cith&aelig;ron, a shepherd of the house of Laius gave you to me; your
feet were pierced, and I believe that you were born in the royal
household." Terrible word, Cith&aelig;ron! It echoes through this
tragedy with horror&mdash;its scaurs and pastures, the scene of the first
crime. And now those two hinds, who had met there once, apparently
by chance, with the child of doom between them, are
being again, as though by chance, brought face to face, with the
man of doom between them, in order to make good the words of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>Teiresias:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Jocasta is struck dumb by the answers of the messenger. She,
and she alone, knows now at last the whole truth; but she does
not speak, while &#338;dipus continues asking who the shepherd of
the house of Laius was. Then she utters words of fearful import,
praying the king to go no farther, nor to seek what, found, will
plunge his soul into despair like hers. After this, finding her suit
ineffectual, she retires into the palace. The chorus are struck by
the wildness of her gestures, and hint their dread that she is going
to her doom of suicide. But &#338;dipus, not yet fully enlightened,
and preoccupied with the problem which interests himself
so deeply, only imagines that she shrinks from the possible proof
of his base birth. As yet, he does not suspect that he is the own
son of Laius; and here, it may be said in passing, the sole weakness
of the plot transpires. Neither the oracle first given to him
at Delphi, nor the plain speech of Teiresias, nor the news of the
Corinthian messenger, nor the pleadings of Jocasta, are sufficient
to suggest the real truth to his mind. Such profundity of blindness
is dramatically improbable. He is, however, soon destined
to receive illumination. The servant of Laius, who gave Jocasta
intelligence of the manner of her husband's death, is now brought
upon the stage; and in him the Corinthian messenger recognizes
the same shepherd who had given him the infant on Cith&aelig;ron.
Though reluctant to confess the truth so long concealed, the shepherd
is at last forced to reveal all he knows; and in this supreme
moment &#338;dipus discovers that he is not only the murderer of his
own father, but also that Jocasta is his mother. In the madness
of this revelation he rushes to the palace. The chorus are left
alone to moralize upon these terrible events. Then another messenger
arrives. Jocasta has hanged herself within her bedchamber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
&#338;dipus, breaking bars and bolts in the fire of his despair,
has followed her. Around him were the servants, drawn together
by the tumult. None, however, dared approach him. Led by an
inner impulse, he found the place where his wife and mother
hung, released the corpse, and tearing from her dress the golden
buckles, cut out both his eyes, crying aloud that no longer should
they look upon the light or be witness to his woe, seeing that
when they might have aided him they were as good as blind.
Thus one day turned the prosperity of &#338;dipus to "wailing, woe,
death, disgrace, all evils that have name&mdash;not one is absent." The
speech of the messenger narrating these events is a splendid instance
of the energy of Sophocles, when he chooses to describe a
terrible event appallingly. It does not convey the &AElig;schylean
mystery of brooding horror; but the scene is realized in all its
incidents, briefly, vividly, with ghastly clearness. Meanwhile, the
voice of &#338;dipus himself is heard. He bids the palace-doors be
opened, in order that all Thebes may see the parricide, the monster
of unhallowed, indescribable abominations. So the gates are
rolled asunder: and there lies dead Jocasta; and sightless &#338;dipus,
with bloody cheeks and beard, stands over her, and the halls
are filled with wailing women and woe-stricken men.</p>

<p>Here, if this had been a modern tragedy, the play of <i>&#338;dipus
Tyrannus</i> might have ended; but so abrupt and scenical a conclusion
did not suit the art of Sophocles. He had still further to
develop the character of &#338;dipus, and to offer the prospect of
that future reconciliation between the fate and the passions of his
hero which he had in store. For this purpose the last two hundred
lines of the drama, though they do not continue the plot,
but rather suggest a new and secondary subject of interest, are invaluable.
Hitherto we have seen &#338;dipus in the pride of monarchy
and manhood, hasty, arrogant, yet withal a just and able
ruler. He is now, through a &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#8051;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#945;, or revol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>ution of circumstances,
more complete than any other in Greek tragedy, revealed
in the very depth of his calamity, still dignified. There is no resistance
left in the once so strong and stubborn man. The hand
of God, weighing heavily upon him, has bowed his head, and he is
humble as a little child. Yet the vehemence that marked his former
phase persists. It finds vent in the passionate lucidity wherewith
he examines all the details of the pollution he has unwittingly
incurred, and in the rage with which he demands to have his
own curse carried out against him. Let him be cast from the
city, sent forth to wander on the fells of Cith&aelig;ron&mdash;&#959;&#8017;&#956;&#8056;&#962; &#922;&#953;&#952;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8060;&#957; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;.
It was the highest achievement of tragic art to exhibit
so suddenly, and by so sharp a transition, this new development
of the king's nature. Saul of Tarsus, when blinded by the vision,
was not more immediately converted from one mood into another,
more contrite in profound sincerity of sorrow. Still in the altered
&#338;dipus we see the same man, the same temperament;
though all internal and external circumstances have been changed,
so that henceforward he will never tread the paths of life as once
he did. The completeness of his self-abandonment appears most
vividly in the dialogue with Creon, upon whose will his immediate
fate depends. When Creon, whom he had lately misjudged
and treated with violent harshness, comes and greets him kindly,
the wretched king tastes the very bitterness of degradation, yet he
is not abject. He only prays once more, with intensest urgency
of pleading, to have the uttermost of the excommunication he had
vowed, executed upon his head. Thinking less of himself than of
the miserable beings associated with him in disaster, he beseeches
Creon to inter the queen, and, for his boys, to give them only a
fair chance in life&mdash;they will be men, and may carve out their
own fortunes in the world; but for his two poor girls, left desolate,
a scorn and mockery to all men, he can only pray that they
may come to him, be near him, bear the burden of their misery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
by their father's side. The tenderness of &#338;dipus for Ismene and
Antigone, his yearning to clasp them, is terribly&mdash;almost painfully&mdash;touching,
when we remember who they were, how born, the
children of what curses. The words with which the king addresses
them are even hazardous in their directness. Yet it was
needful that humanity should by some such strain of passion be
made to emerge from this tempest of soul-shattering woes; and
thus, too, a glimpse of that future is provided which remained for
&#338;dipus, if sorrowful, assuaged at least by filial love. In reply to
all his eloquent supplications Creon answers that he will not take
upon himself the responsibility of dealing with his case. Nothing
can be done without consulting the oracle at Delphi. &#338;dipus
has, therefore, to be patient and endure. The strong hero, who
saved Thebes from the Sphinx and swayed the city, is now in the
hands of tutors and governors awaiting his doom. He submits
quietly, and the tragedy is ended.</p>

<p>The effect of such a tragedy as <i>&#338;dipus the King</i> is to make
men feel that the earth is shaken underneath them, and that the
heavens above are big with thunder. Compassion and fear are
agitated in the highest degree; old landmarks seem to vanish; the
mightiest have fallen, and the most impious, convinced of God,
have been goaded to self-murder. Great, indeed, is the tragic
poet's genius who can make the one sure point amid this confusion
the firmness of its principal fore-destined victim. That is the
triumph of Sophocles. Out of the chaos of the <i>&#338;dipus Tyrannus</i>
springs the new order of the <i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i>; and here it
may be said that perhaps the most valid argument in favor of the
&AElig;schylean trilogy as a supreme work of dramatic art is this&mdash;that
such a tragedy as the first &#338;dipus demanded such another
as the second. The new motives suggested in the last act were
not sufficiently worked out to their conclusion; much that happened
in the climax of the <i>Tyrannus</i> seemed to necessitate th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>e
<i>Colone&uuml;s</i>.</p>

<p>The interest of the <i>&#338;dipus Tyrannus</i> centres in its plot, and
that is my only excuse for having dwelt so long on the structure
of a play familiar to every student. That of the <i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i>
is different. It has, roughly speaking, no plot. It owes its perfect,
almost superhuman, beauty to the atmosphere which bathes
it, as with peace after tempest, with the lucid splendors of sunset
succeeding to a storm-vexed and tumultuous day. The scene is
laid, as the name indicates, in the village birthplace of the poet.
Years are supposed to have elapsed since the conclusion of the
former tragedy; &#338;dipus, after being detained in Thebes against
his will at first, has now been driven forth by Creon, and has wandered
many miles in blindness, led by his daughter's hand. The
ethical interest of the play, so far as it is not absorbed by &#338;dipus
himself, centres principally in Antigone, whereby we are prepared
for her emergence into fullest prominence in the tragedy which
bears her name. Always keeping in mind that these three plays
are not a trilogy, I cannot but insist again that much is lost, especially
in all that concerns the unfolding of Antigone's character,
by not reading them in the order suggested by the fable. At the
same time, though Antigone engrosses our sympathy and attention,
Sophocles has varied the drama by a more than usual number
of persons. The generous energy of Theseus forms a fine
contrast to the inactivity forced upon &#338;dipus by the conditions
of the subject, and also to the meanness of Creon; while the episodes
of Ismene's arrival, of Antigone's abduction, and of the visit
of Polyneices, add movement to what might else have been too
stationary. It should also be said that all these subsidiary sources
of interest are used with subtle art by Sophocles for enhancing
the dignity of &#338;dipus, for arousing our sympathy with him, and
for bringing into prominence the chief features of his character.
None can, therefore, be regarded as superfluous, though, stric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>tly
speaking, they might have been detached without absolute destruction
of the drama, which is more than can be said about the
slightest incidents of <i>&#338;dipus Tyrannus</i>. As regards &#338;dipus
himself, that modification of his fiery temperament which Sophocles
revealed at the end of the first tragedy has now become permanent.
He is schooled into submission; yet he has not lost the
old impetuosity that formed the groundwork of his nature. He
is still quick to anger and vehement in speech, but both his anger
and his vehemence are justified by the occasion. Something,
moreover, of fateful and mysterious, severing him from the common
race of men and shrouding him within the seclusion of his
dread calamity, has been added. The terror of his dreadful past,
and the prospect of his august future, environ him with more than
kingly dignity. The skill of Sophocles as a dramatic poet is displayed
in all its splendor by the new light thrown upon the central
figure of &#338;dipus. The effect of unity is not destroyed: those
painful shocks to our sense of probability so frequent when inferior
dramatists&mdash;poets of the rank of Fletcher or of Jonson&mdash;attempt
to depict a nature altered by internal reformation or by
force of circumstance do not occur. The &#338;dipus of both the
tragedies remains one man; we understand the change that has
been wrought in him; and while we feel that it is adequate and
natural, we marvel at the wisdom of the poet who could vary his
design with so much firmness.</p>

<p>The oracle, which continues to play an important part in this
tale of Thebes, has warned &#338;dipus that he will end his days within
the precincts of the Semnai Theai, or august goddesses of retribution.
In his new phase the man of haste and wrath is no
longer heedless of oracles; nor does he let their words lie idle in
his mind. It is, therefore, with a strong presentiment of approaching
death that he discovers early in this play that his feet, led by
Antigone, have rested in the grove of the Furies at Colonus. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
place itself is fair. There are here no harpy-gorgons with bloodshot
eyes, and vipers twining in their matted hair. The meadows
are dewy, with crocus-flowers and narcissus; in the thickets of
olive and laurel nightingales keep singing; and rivulets spread
coolness in the midst of summer's heat. The whole wood is
hushed, and very fresh and wild. A solemn stillness broods there;
for the feet of the profane keep far away, and none may tread the
valley-lawns but those who have been purified. The ransomed of
the Lord walk there. This solemnity of peace pervades the whole
play, forming, to borrow a phrase from painting, the silver-gray
harmony of the picture. In thus bringing &#338;dipus to die among
the unshowered meadows of those Dread Ladies, whom in his
troubled life he found so terrible, but whom in his sublime passage
from the world he is about to greet resignedly, we may trace
peculiar depth of meaning. The thought of death, calm but austere,
tempers every scene in the drama. We are in the presence
of one whose life is ended, who is about to merge the fever of existence
in the tranquillity beyond. This impression of solemnity
is heightened when we remember that the poet wrote the <i>Colone&uuml;s</i>
in extreme old age. Over him, too, the genius of everlasting
repose already spread wings in the twilight, and the mysteries of
the grave were nearer to him and more daily present than to other
men.</p>

<p>A country fellow, who perceives &#338;dipus seated by his daughter
on a marble bench within the sacred precinct, bids them quit the
spot, for it is hallowed. &#338;dipus, however, knowing that his
doom shall be fulfilled, asks that he may be confronted with the
elders of the place. They come and gaze with mingled feelings
of distrust and awe on the blind hero, august in desolation. Before
they can converse with him, &#338;dipus has to quit the recesses
of the grove, and gain a spot where speech and traffic are permitted.
Then, in answer to their questions, he informs them who he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
is&mdash;&#338;dipus. At that name they start back in horror, demanding
that he shall carry the abomination of his presence from their
land. This affords the occasion for a splendid speech from the
old man, one of the most telling passages of eloquence in Sophocles,
in which he appeals to the time-long hospitality and fame for
generosity of Athens. Athens was never known to spurn the
suppliant or expel the stranger, and the deeds of &#338;dipus they so
much dread are sufferings rather:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#8054; &#964;&#8049; &#947;' &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#945; &#956;&#959;&#965;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The Chorus, moved by the mingled impetuosity and sound reasoning
of their suitor, perceive that the case is too grave for them
to decide. Accordingly, they send a messenger for Theseus; but,
before he can be summoned, Ismene arrives on horseback with the
news that her brothers are quarrelling about the throne of Thebes.
Eteocles, the younger, has usurped the sovereignty, while Polyneices
has fled to Argos to engage the chiefs of the Achaians in
his cause. Both parties, meantime, are eager to secure the person
of &#338;dipus, since an oracle has proclaimed that with him will victory
abide. &#338;dipus, hearing these tidings, bursts into a strain of
passionate denunciation, which proves that the old fire of his temper
is smouldering still unquenched. When he was forlorn and
in misery, his unnatural sons took no thought of him. They sent
him forth to roam a pariah upon the earth, leaving to his daughters
the care and burden of supporting him. Now, basely anxious
for their selfish profit, they come to claim possession of his old,
world-wearied flesh. Instead of blessings, they shall meet with
curses. Instead of the fair land of Thebes to lord it over, they
shall barely get enough ground to die and be buried in. He,
meanwhile, will abide at Athens, and bequeath a heritage of help
and honor to her soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chorus now call upon &#338;dipus to perform the rites of purification
required by the Eumenides&mdash;rites which Sophocles has
described with the loving minuteness of one to whom the customs
of Colonus were from boyhood sacred. Ismene goes to
carry out their instructions, and in her absence Theseus arrives
upon the scene. Theseus, throughout the drama, plays towards
&#338;dipus the part of a good-hearted hospitable friend. His generosity
is ethically contrasted with the meanness of Creon and
the selfishness of Polyneices, while, artistically, the practical energy
of his character serves for a foil to the stationary dignity of
the chief actor. Sophocles has thus contrived to give weight and
importance to a personage who might, in weaker hands, have been
degraded into a mere instrument. &#338;dipus assures the Attic
king that he will prove no useless and unserviceable denizen.
The children of Erechtheus, whose interests rank first in the
mind of Theseus, will find him in the future a powerful and god-protected
sojourner within their borders. His natural sympathy
for the persecuted and oppressed having been thus strengthened
by the prospect of reciprocal advantage, Theseus formally accepts
&#338;dipus as a suppliant, and promises him full protection.
At this point, forming, as it were, a halting-place in the action
of the play, Sophocles introduced that famous song about Colonus,
which no one has yet succeeded in translating, but which,
for modern ears, has received new value from the music of Mendelssohn.</p>

<p>What follows, before the final climax of the drama, consists of
the efforts made by Creon, on the part of Eteocles, and by Polyneices,
to enlist &#338;dipus respectively upon their sides in the war
of succession to the Theban throne. Creon displays his heartless,
cunning, impudent, sophistical, and forceful character, while
&#338;dipus opposes indignation and contempt, unmasking his hypocrisy,
and stripping his specious arguments of all that hides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
their naked selfishness. In this scene we feel that Sophocles is
verging upon the Euripidean manner. A little more would make
the altercation between Creon and &#338;dipus pass over into a forensic
wrangling-match. As it is, the chief dramatic value of the
episode is to exhibit the grandeur of the wrath of &#338;dipus in its
righteous heat when contrasted with the wretched shifts of a mere
rhetorical sophist.</p>

<p>After Creon, by the help of Theseus, has been thwarted in his
attempt to carry off Antigone, Polyneices approaches with crocodile
tears, fawning intercessions, and fictitious sorrow for his father's
desolation. &#338;dipus flashes upon his covert egotism the
same light of clear unclouded insight which had unmasked Creon.
"What," he asks, "is the value of tears now, of prayers now?
Dry were your eyes, hard as stone your heart, dumb your lips,
when I went forth from Thebes unfriended. Here is your guerdon:
Before Thebes's walls you shall die, pierced by your brother's
hand, and your brother by yours." The imprecation of the
father upon the son would be unnatural, were it not for the son's
falseness, who behaved like a Regan to &#338;dipus in his calamity,
and who now, when the old man has become a mysteriously
important personage, seeks to make the most of him for his own
uses.</p>

<p>The protracted dialogues with Creon and Polyneices serve to
enhance the sublimity of &#338;dipus. He, all the while, is seated, a
blind, travel-stained, neglected mendicant, upon the marble bench
of the Eumenides. There is horror in his very aspect. Hellas
rings with the abominations connected with his name. Yet, to
this poor pariah, to this apparent object of pity and loathing,
come princes and warriors capable of stirring all the States of
Greece in conflict. He rejects them, firm in his consciousness of
heaven-appointed destiny. Sophocles seems bent on showing
how the wrath of God may be turned aside from its most signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
and notorious victims by real purity of heart and nobleness of
soul; how, from the depths of degradation and affliction, the
spirit of man may rise; and how the lot of demigods may be
reserved for those whom the world ignorantly judges worthy of
its scorn. &#338;dipus of late stood like the lightning-blasted tree
that travellers dread&mdash;the <i>evitandum bidental</i> of Roman superstition.
His withered limbs have now more health and healing in
them than the leaf-embowered forest oak.</p>

<p>The treatment of Polyneices in the <i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i> supplies
a good example of the Sophoclean tendency to humanize the ancient
myths of Hellas. The curse pronounced by &#338;dipus formed
an integral element of that portion of the legend which suggested
to &AElig;schylus the <i>Seven against Thebes</i>. By its force, the
whole weight of the doom that overhangs the house of Laius is
brought to bear upon the suicidal brethren, both of whom rush
helplessly, with eyes open, to meet inevitable fate.</p>

<p>are the opening words of the prayer of Eteocles in that tragedy;
while phrases like these, &#8038; &#960;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#948;&#8057;&#956;&#969;&#957; &#957;&#8051;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#8150;&#963;&#953; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#956;&#953;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#962;

burden of the choric songs. Sophocles does not seek to make the
wrath of &#338;dipus less terrible; he adheres to the old outline of
the story, and heightens the tragic horror of the curse by framing
for it words intense by reason of their very calculated calmness
(1383-1396). At the same time he shows how the obstinate
temper of Polyneices, and his sense of honor, are necessary to its
operation. After the dreadful sentence, dooming him to self-murder
by his brother's spear, has been pronounced, Polyneices
stands before his father and his sister like one stunned. Antigone,
with a woman's instinct, entreats him to choose the onl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>y
way still left of safety. He may disband the army, and retire
from the adventure against Thebes. To this her brother answers:</p>

<p>when she persists, he repeats &#956;&#8052; &#960;&#949;&#8150;&#952;' &#7939; &#956;&#8052; &#948;&#949;&#8150;. Thus, instead of
bringing into strong relief the operation of blind fate, Sophocles
places in the foreground the human agencies which contribute to
the undoing of Polyneices. His crime of unfilial egotism, his
dread of being thought a coward, and his honor rooted in dishonor,
drive him through the tempest of his father's curse upon the
rock of doom. The part played by Antigone in this awful scene
of altercation between her father and her brother, first interceding
for mercy, and then striving to break the stubborn will of the
rebellious youth,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> prepares our minds for the tragedy in which
she will appear as protagonist. Hitherto she has been remarkable
for filial love. She now shows herself a gentle and tender
sister to one who had deeply wronged her. The absolute unselfishness
which gives to her the beauty as of some clear, flawless
jewel shines forth by anticipation in the <i>Colone&uuml;s</i>, enlisting our
warmest sympathies upon her side, and tempering the impression
of hardness that might be produced by a simple study of the
<i>Antigone</i>.</p>

<p>When Polyneices, with the curse still ringing in his ears, has
fled forth, Cain-like, from the presence of his father, thunder is
heard, and the end approaches. The chief actors, led by the
blind hero, move from the stage in order suited to the processional
gravity of the Greek theatre, while the speech of the Messenger,
conveying to the Chorus the news of the last minutes in the
life of &#338;dipus, prepares the spectators for the reappearance of
his daughters on the scene. As in the <i>&#338;dipus Tyrannus</i>, so now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>a new motive of interest is introduced in the last act of the drama.
The <i>Antigone</i> is imperatively demanded as a sequel. Our attention
is riveted upon Antigone, who in losing her father has lost
all. Her first thought is that he died nobly, peacefully, at one
with God. Her next thought is that she shall never see him
again, never more bear the sweet burden of anxiety and pain for
him, never even have access to his hidden tomb. Her third
thought is a longing to be dead with him, enfolded in oblivion
of the fate which persecutes her kith and kin. Life stretches before
her boundless, homeless, comfortless, nor has she now a single
memory for him whose love might have consoled a woman of
less stubborn soul&mdash;for H&aelig;mon. It is characteristic of his whole
conception of Antigone that Sophocles introduced no allusion to
that underplot of love at this point. When Theseus reproves
her for despair, she awakes to fresh unselfishness: "Send me to
Thebes," she cries, "that I may stay, if possible, my brothers'
strife." Throughout this final scene the single-hearted heat and
firm will of Antigone, her desire for action, and her readiness to
accept responsibility are contrasted with Ismene's yielding temper
and passivity. We are thus prepared for the opening of the
third drama, which, though written first by Sophocles, is the artistic
close and climax of the tale of Thebes.</p>

<p>The most perfect female character in Greek poetry is Antigone.
She is purely Greek, unlike any woman of modern fiction, except
perhaps the Fedalma of George Eliot. In her filial piety, in her
intercession for Polyneices at the knees of &#338;dipus, in her grief
when her father is taken from her, she does, indeed, resemble the
women whom most men among us have learned to honor in their
sisters or their daughters or their mother. Of such women the
Greek maiden, with her pure calm face and virginal straight lines
of classic drapery, is still the saint and patroness. But what shall
we say of the Antigone of this last drama, of the sister who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
willing, lest her brother lie unburied on the Theban plain, to lay
her own life down, disobeying the law of her sovereign, defying
Creon to the face, appealing against unjust tribunals to the judgment-seat
of powers more ancient than the throne of Zeus himself,
and marching to her living tomb with dauntless strength in
order that the curse-attainted ghost of Polyneices shall have rest
in Hades? To the modern mind she appears a being from another
sphere. A strain of unearthly music seems to announce
her entrance and her exit on the stage. That the sacrifice of the
sister's very life, the breaking of her plighted troth to H&aelig;mon,
should follow upon the sprinkling of those few handfuls of dust&mdash;that
she should give that life up smilingly, nor ever in her last
hours breathe her lover's name&mdash;is a tragic circumstance for which
our sympathies are not prepared: we can neither divest our minds
of the fixed modern prejudice that the first duty of a woman is to
her husband, nor can we fully enter into the antique superstition
of defrauded sepulture. Yet it is necessary to do both of these
things, to sequester Antigone from the sphere of modern obligations,
and to enter hand in hand with her the inner sanctuary of
antique piety, in order to do justice to the conception of Sophocles.
This effort of the imagination may be facilitated by remembering,
first, that Antigone inherited her father's proud self-will&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#948;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#8150; &#964;&#8056; &#947;&#8051;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#956;' &#8032;&#956;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#958; &#8032;&#956;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8056;&#962;<br /></span>

<p>and, secondly, that disaster after disaster, the loss of &#338;dipus, the
death of her two brothers, has come huddling upon her in a storm
of fate, so that life is, in a manner, over for her, and she feels
isolated in a cold and cruel world. This combination of her character
and her circumstances renders her action in the <i>Antigone</i>
conceivable. Without the hardness she inherited from &#338;dipus,
she could not have gone through her tragic part. Without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
vow she registered above her father's grave, to bring help to her
brethren, seeing that they alone were left, the sentiment of her last
speech would sound rhetorical. Moreover, the poet who breathed
into her form a breath of life so fiery has himself justified us in
regarding her act as one removed from the plain path of virtue.
Antigone was no Hindoo widow to die upon a husband's pyre.
Her heroism, her resistance offered to the will of Creon, had in it
a splendid criminality. It was just the casuistry of the conflict
between public and private obligations, between the dictates of
her conscience and the commands of her sovereign, that enabled
Sophocles to render the peculiar stoicism of her character pathetic.
In spite of all these considerations, it is probable that she
will strike a modern reader at the first as frigid. Especially, if he
have failed to observe the <i>nuances</i> of her portrait in the <i>&#338;dipus
Colone&uuml;s</i>, he will be inclined to wish that Sophocles had softened
here and there the outlines of her adamantine statue. Yet, after
long contemplation of those perfect lineaments, we come to recognize
in her a purity of passion, a fixity of purpose, a loyalty of
kinship, a sublime enthusiasm for duty, simply conceived and self-justified
in spite of all conventions to the contrary, which soar
above the strain of modern tragic sentiment. Even Alfieri, in
the noble drawing he has sketched from the Sophoclean picture,
could not abstain from violating its perfection by this sentimental
touch of common feeling:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">Emone, ah! tutto io sento,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tutto l' amor, che a te portava: io sento<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il dolor tutto, a cui ti lascio.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No such words are to be found in Sophocles upon the lips of the
dying Antigone. She is all for her father and her brothers. The
tragedy of H&aelig;mon belongs to Creon, not to her. Her furthest
concessions to the sympathies which might have swayed a weaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
woman are found in this line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8038; &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#964;&#945;&#952;' &#913;&#7991;&#956;&#959;&#957;, &#8037;&#962; &#963;' &#7936;&#964;&#953;&#956;&#8049;&#950;&#949;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#8053;&#961;,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and in the passage of the Kommos where she bewails her luckless
lot of maidenhood. For the rest, Sophocles has sustained
her character as that of one "whom, like sparkling steel, the
strokes of chance made hard and firm." This steely durability,
this crystalline sparkle, divide her not only from the ideal raised
by romance for womanhood, but distinguish her, as the daughter
of &#338;dipus, from the general sisterhood even of Greek heroines.</p>

<p>The peculiar qualities of Antigone are brought into sharp relief
by the milder virtues of Ismene, who thinks it right to obey
Creon, and who has no spirit for the deed of daring, but who is
afterwards eager to share the punishment of her sister. Antigone
repels her very sternly, herein displaying the force of her nature
under its less amiable aspect: "Have courage! Thou livest, but
my soul long since hath died." The glory of the act is hers
alone. Ismene has no right to share it when the risks are past,
the penalty is paid. Antigone's repulsion of her sister seems to
supply the key to her own heroism. "&#338;dipus," she says, "is
dead; my brethren are dead: for them I lived, and in their
death I died to life; but you&mdash;your heart is not shut up within
your father's and your brother's grave; it is still warm, still eager
for love and the joys of this world. Live, then. For me it would
be no more possible to live such life as yours than for the clay-cold
corpse upon the bier."</p>

<p>The character of Creon, darkened in its tone and shadow to the
utmost with a view to affording a foil of another species for Antigone,
was thought worthy of minute and careful treatment by
Sophocles. In the <i>&#338;dipus Tyrannus</i> he is wronged rather than
wronging. While suffering from the unjust suspicion and hasty
language of the king, he pleads his cause with decent gravity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
shows no sign of either arrogance or cowardice. At the end,
when &#338;dipus has fallen, his own behavior is such as would not
disgrace a generous as well as prudent prince. The neutrality
for good or evil which distinguishes Creon in this play, marking
him out in contrast with the fiery heat of &#338;dipus, the impious
irony of Jocasta, is, to say the least, respectable. In the <i>&#338;dipus
Colone&uuml;s</i> he plays a consistently mean and odious part; his pragmatical
display of rhetoric before the burghers of Colonus, when
tested by his violent and cruel conduct towards Antigone, proves
him to be a hollow-hearted and specious hypocrite. The light
here reflected back upon his respectability in the <i>Tyrannus</i> is decidedly
unfavorable. In the <i>Antigone</i> Creon becomes, if possible,
still more odious; only our animosity against him is tempered
by contempt. To the faults of egotism, hardness, and hypocritical
prating, are now added the infatuation of self-will and the godless
hatred of a dead foe. There is, indeed, a show of right in
the decree published concerning the two brothers, one of whom
had brought a foreign army against Thebes; but it would be
sophistry to maintain that Creon was actuated by patriotic motives.
The defeat and death of Polyneices were punishment
enough. By pursuing his personal spite beyond the grave Creon
insults the common instincts of humanity, the sympathies of the
people, and the supposed feelings of the gods, who cannot bear
to gaze upon abominations. The pathetic self-devotion of Antigone,
the voice of the city, the remonstrances of H&aelig;mon, and
the warnings of Teiresias are all thrown away upon his stubborn
and conceited obstinacy. He shows himself, in short, to be a
tyrant of the orthodox sort. Like a tyrant, he is, moreover, absurdly
suspicious: the guardian has, he thinks, been bought; Ismene
must be hatching treason; H&aelig;mon prefers a woman to his
duty; Teiresias is plotting for the sake of gain against him.
When it is just too late, he gives way helplessly and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>feebly,
moved to terror by the dark words of the seer. Creon is, therefore,
a mixed character, great neither for good nor for evil, weak
through wilfulness, plausible in words and wavering in his determinations,
a man who might have passed for excellent if he had
never had to wield a kingdom's power. His own description of
himself&mdash;&#956;&#8049;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945;&mdash;suits him not only in the utter collapse
of his character and rain of his fortunes, but also in the height of
his prosperity and fulness of his seeming strength.</p>

<p>Sophocles might fairly be censured for having made the misery
of Creon the climax of a drama which ought to have had its whole
interest centred in Antigone. Our sympathies have not been
sufficiently enlisted on the side of H&aelig;mon to make us care much
about his death. For Eurydice it is impossible to rouse more
than a languid pity. Creon, we feel, gets no more than he deserves;
instead of being sorry for him, we are only angry that he
was not swept away into the dustheap of oblivion sooner. It
was surely a mistake to divert the attention of the audience, at
the very end of the tragedy, from its heroine to a character which,
like that of Creon, rouses impatient scorn as well as antipathy.
That Sophocles had artistic reasons for not concluding this play
with the death of Antigone may be readily granted by those who
have made the crises of the <i>Ajax</i>, the <i>&#338;dipus Tyrannus</i>, and the
<i>&#338;dipus Colone&uuml;s</i> the subject of special study. He preferred, it
seems, to relax the strained sympathies of his audience by a prolongation
of the drama on an altered theme. Yet this scarcely
justifies the shifting of the centre of interest attempted in the
<i>Antigone</i>. We have to imagine that the inculcation of a moral
lesson upon the crime of &#7936;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945; was the poet's paramount object.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
If so, he sacrificed dramatic effect to ethics.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that Antigone, in whom the fate of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>family of Laius is finally accomplished, falls an innocent victim.
Her tragedy is no immediate consequence of the &#338;dipodean
curse. While her brethren were wilfully involved in the doom
of their house, she perished in the cause of divine charity. Finding
that the immutable ordinances of Heaven clashed with the
arbitrary volition of a ruler, she preferred to obey the law of
conscience and to die at the behest of a pride-maddened tyrant.
She is technically disobedient, morally most duteous. Thus
the <i>Antigone</i> carries us beyond the region of hereditary disaster
into the more universal sphere of ethical casuistry. Its
tragic interest depends less upon the evolution of the law of
ancestral guilt than on the conflict of two duties. By suggesting
the casuistical question to his audience, while he freed his
heroine from all doubt upon the subject, Sophocles maintained
the sublime simplicity which distinguishes Antigone above all
women of romance. The retribution that falls on Creon furnishes
a powerful example of the Greek doctrine of Nemesis;
but over Antigone herself Nemesis exerts no sway. In her action
there was nothing unconsidered; in her doom there was
nothing unforeseen.</p>
